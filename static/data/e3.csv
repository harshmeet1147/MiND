reviews
"""I purchased this product last month and found it to be excellent. The TDS of the purified water is less than 35, while the water in our area typically has a TDS of around 650. The customer care service is commendable; they handled a minor complaint with great care. There are a total of 7 filters, including a UV light purifier. It is definitely worth buying. If you are in search of a good water purifier priced around 4k, don't hesitate to purchase it. I will update you on its durability after a few months."""
"""I'm extremely pleased with the stylish and affordable product offered by Brand Livpure. It not only looks great but also comes at a very reasonable price point. With this purchase, I no longer have to worry about spending extra on servicing. A big thank you to Livpure for offering 30 months free service.Thank you Livpure and Amazon."
"""I'm happy to report that the system installation was successful and it's functioning well. The water quality is of high standard."""
"""Looks like a refurbished item received; there were water droplets inside the new filter that came with this product. The product was fine, which is why I didn't return it."""
"""Terrible product, even worse customer service! Eureka Water purified not only tastes like chemicals, but when I reached out to customer service to address the issue, I was met with indifference and unhelpfulness. They couldn't care less about resolving the problem. Avoid this brand at all costs unless you enjoy wasting your money and being treated poorly."""
"""We're loving our new RO system! Water tastes amazing—clear, pure, and refreshing. The installation team was efficient and left no mess behind. It's a relief to have such high-quality water straight from our tap, making cooking and drinking a joy. No more bottled water purchases, saving money and reducing plastic waste. Highly recommend this system for anyone wanting great-tasting water and a hassle-free installation experience.”"

.....working fine tilll now.... plastic quality ok ok he h ....thoda  improve ho Jaye to behtr... overall gd product
'@LivpureSmart this is worst water purifier I am using. The product is pathetic and have some or the other problem.I bought a new purifier in Nov 23 but has to face problems every month since thenNo permanent solutionSuggestion not to buy this product!! 👿
"“The product quality is consistently outstanding, exceeding my expectations every time.I am completely impressed with their professionalism and customer service.Their staff is not only friendly but also highly skilled.”Pricing is fair and transparent definitely value for money.”"
1 st day Review is best ro
1). Without power stored water should despense. 2). Heater temp setting is little difficult. 3). It should auto turn off heater when not in use.  4). I had to raise installation rrquest after buying. It should have been automatic and Its installed after 3-4 days of buying.
"1. The purifier was not working at the day of installation2. After repair, it is not cleaning the water.3. I am spending extra cost of repair."
1. This filter comes with timer and not water consumption meter.2. It does not matter how much you use it. It will expire within a year.3. This is a clear cheating by the company.4. Technician says there is other models which will not come with timer and will work till full capacity is used.5. They should have mentioned this clearly in the product display when buying. That's why I feel this is clear cheating.
1.Display is not functioning after 1month.2. Water will not come if no power3. Sensors are not working properly4. Customer care People are also not responding5. Zero product valueDon't purchase just checking in Reviews what I did. I would not recommended anybody to purchase this product
"1.TDS is not managed properly,when it was installed TDS was 70 but suddenly within 2days it dropped to 10 which is indeed harmful.(Mentioning water source didn't changed)2.Earlier water was too tasty,but now after a week and resolution for low TDS by company water lost its taste and taste same like municipality water,and more importantly they says they can't do a thing for that which is very disappointing3.IOT they used is just complete fraud,when actual TDS(measured using TDS METRE) was 10 app was showing 50-60,like literally they have set it to not to show below 50 to make believe it's safe according to WHO standards.Then question arises if app doesn't shows correct TDS will it even show correct health condition of various components which I doubt.4.Company said it's water capacity is 8litres I bet it's not.It might be 5-6 litres and surely not 8litres.5.Customer care is not supportive and they threatened company/customer care will not respond if you add complaints for Water Quality anymore as it was by 3rd complaint for water quality first for low TDS which they didn't solved at first second was again for low TDS which was solved but then water taste was lost for which I called third time and that time they literally said if I add too much complaints they can't do anything which means they cannot solve customer queries.Sadly I'm too much disappointed by the product and I feel I waste 18k,though one thing I liked you can get support quickly unlike Aquaguard and some companies,but sadly solution is not guaranteed..."
"1.There is a huge wastage of water that keeps on flowing out whenever  you collect Water from the purifier.2.Not possible to collect water in water bottles, due to the design  of the purifier.3.The nozzle  discharging water is inadequate.Please take note and rectify."
1.Very good buy2.proved that it’s a trusted brand3.very good serviceOnly con is the price is on the higher side
1/10 for the service provided for the service provided. Please do not bye aquaguard products
10 din m khrab ho gya h 😱

4 महीने से प्रयोग क़र रहा हूँ no problemक्या गारंटी है अधिक पैसा वाला अच्छा होगाआज कल ब्रांड मे भी धोखा है 😄
"5.1.24 purchased, after 25 days use, water teste is very good, in this pries its a best product, easy to install, I installed my own, tds adjuster tab is inside the console, adjust as low as possible for best water quality,  buy tds meter for 1st time water quality and again time to time check quality of water 180-200rs, water tds reading 15-30 its a good water quality., note for manufacture- company please give installation guide/manual with it. (for avoid extra service charge)"
6 months into using and no complaints till now
"6 महीने में मशीन खराब हो गया. Urban company के app के द्वारा कस्टमर सर्विस बुक किया, लेकिन 5 दिन बाद भी कोई ठीक करने नहीं आया. Customer Service का कोई नंबर भी नहीं है."

"90% of the population has ground water of tests from 450 to 1300 which is more than enough for NF As TDS gets reduced by 80% which is more than an enough as per the government regulation 200 to 350 is good for drinking . Don’t fall for TDS regulator when used NF 20,40,60,80 as per our water tds you don’t have to use any tds regulator and also water from NF is not acidic like RO water purifier"
A bad smell still remains after 9 days and the water seems heavy than other water purifier like  Pureit.
A best RO in this segment and value for money
A body level fit in mineral water more than benefits.fast half hour tank full so electricity saving resistance flats for good a RO system purchase
A deal. Best brand and super customer service and quick installation.
"A good investment for middle class people as well as it is very  budget friendly  i would highly recommend you guys to order this item without any doubt , Installation is also done within 24 hours after the delivery"
A good product and recommend everyone to have it.

A Great product with highly satisfied services.
A great purchase good and quick installation cheap and best water purifier
A great value for money product and the service provided for the installation was so smooth. As the installation person Aijaz Majeed was very cooperative and handled everything with care.
"A product which gives more value for money than any other Pureit or Aquaguard product, that also comes with 2 year warranty for every item, after which we have the option to purchase 2 year AMC for the lowest cost in the market at Rs. 4500.Great value for money overall. Plus, the all-black body looks very good. I admire it each time I enter the kitchen."
A superb product and excellent customer service. UC service is more than what I thought. Lightening response from the team. Would rate more than 5 Star.
A very good and controls the TDS really well.
A very good purifier with very less water wastage and good refilling speed.
"A very good value for money product, timely delivery and installation."
"A wonderful 7 stage water filter, with no techie hassle. Easy to use and easy to operate. Really satisfied with the Installation as well. Good buy"
A.O. Smith Best Company in the WorldUseful Product  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
A0 Smith z2+ water quality and the storage capacity of 5L is good and it takes less time to fill the tank
Ability to fix in corners is something I liked about the product. Slightly noisy otherwise would have given 5 stars.
Accha hai
According to my view our daily needs were fulfilled with this filter..And it clears lot work done to get water from outside
Acha h pani ka test bhi acha lga or acha chal bhi rha h thank uVery very nice thank u
Achha rha prodekt
"Actually I got it as not properly assembled...in that copper filter was broken.UV chamber was also not there..we bought it from outside..the installation man behaved so rudely,he doesn't respond the call at first, later he attend the call & his attitude of the speech was too bad...then my husband called a nearby installation person from our area, he did it some what ok.. we aren't satisfied...but still after installing UV chamber & without the copper filter also,the taste of the water is good.."
"Actually smaller than it appears in imageBut works very efficiently , installation was good."
Adding stars so it will not be removed later here for the negative reviews given by me.Its a complete scam
Advance features
Advanced purification system without wasting water & good for health.
Aesthetically built with useful features
Affordable and easy to install.Water purifying technology is also good.Quick service.
Affordable price and water quality is good.As per product it’s price is goodInstallation and delivery process is very fast
"After 1.5 months there was problem, and service charges are very high. While installation they asked 700 now for service they asked around 700. And service also very late so I arranged outside"
"After 1-2 months my filter was getting heat , company asked to change filter worth of 1600 and every 6000 litres need to change all filters disappointed with the product"
After 1yr using motor was not working and technicians are not responding not telling proper reson
After 3 days review Good product with reasonable price.
After 4 days as I did not get any call I try to call they service centre which I can't contact as it is incorrect number on their website. So I send mail which I get respond back and call me to tell me they they can not installed in my location which is distric capital. And told me I can return if I want. And he told me they their installation all India in their website is wrong and they need to update. And he tell me they can't service aswell. So at last I call the distributor from other brand and they came to install for me.Thanks to other brand.Don't trust v guard.
"After 6 month of usage my experience is -1. Output water speed is low because of lower size tap.2. Functionality wise is good.3. Getting proper alkline water with TDS value arround 50 to 70.4. Service is good. In case of issue, within 2 day team will resolve your problem.5. They replaced one of my filter recently without any charge.I am happy with this product as of now."
"After 6 months, it's working great. No issues till now"
After 7 days ro charger not working
After a week days there is no any type of problem i am satisfied about this product i hope it give good and satisfactory results in future thank you very much
"After almost 11 months from  purchase the filter suddenly stoppped (the unit under waranty)and logged complaint for service support.. It been 4th day no one from aquaguard service team attended the complaint.. there is continuous follow up thru mails, calls, whatsApp but no use.When I checked who has aquaguard filters are also facing similar issue... Please avoid acquaguard.. their service is very pathetic."
After installation water drop from body and i called them for service but they didn't response. they didn't provide warrant card to me.Not a Good ProductNot a good serviceDon't Buy this
"After installation when we start purifier to see TDS we see leakage in UV cylinder. We opened and checked, incoming water pipe end was broken."
"After installation, their technical didn’t check water TDS and when i asked to customer service they said i have to make another request for it !Water taste is below average at this price range.And even after spending 20K, they didn’t provide PRE-FILTER. No user menual in Box.Not good for this price."
"After lots of searching, I bought it and it was a great choice. The water tastes good and the quality is solid. AO Smith's service is fast and easy. Definitely recommend it to others."
"After one month has past motor jam issue facing, after sleeping to start againMeans : thapki Marne ke baad chalta haiRojana Aisa hi karna padta hai"
After one month hi issue start ho gaye it not worth of money. Starting me fast work krta tha ab one month me hi work krna ek dum se slow ho gaya
After one month use of this RO .. No Report on this.Thanks for this..
After one week usage  unpleasant smell coming from the water.I had changed the filter. But smell  coming. Called for service. But no response. Don't buy. Waste of money.
After purchase this item under 20days my family get suffering from throat infection n high fever when technician came he said Main filter was not working I.e alkaline filter. When I contacted with customer support they send another one it will take almost 15 days reach to me. Than after it satrt working now I face the same problem again.. family is suffering from cough n throat infection than I chk TDS it showing 35. Seriously I had a very bad experience with this alkaline RO.After 4 months I post this review after checking this n I must say pls don't purchase it.
After received the product from Amazon no one was assigned for product installation. We have tried reaching to multiple people from customer care support to get it installed. After 4 months machine stopped working and no one is ready to visit and do the service even AMC is free for 1 year. Pls dnt but any product from Eureka Forbes .Very worst service.
"After several research on the best under the counter water purifier, I zeroed down to go for this AO smith Z2+ model. I’ve been using the product on my flat for around a month now. Water supply TDS is around 800, but once it’s filtered the TDS levels are down to safe level and the dispensed water tastes great. Initially there was some operating issues on the product, as we were not sure how to operate it, but the technical team was quick to respond and visit the flat for a quick re-demo, and thereafter everything was fine. I would definitely recommend to go with this for its ease of use, minimum visibility once installed (as entire filter and remaining products are hidden beneath the counter and you get only a dispensing tap to see) value for money, and most importantly their quick response team efficiency. Thank you."
After several searches and study I finally ordered it and my decision was right. A service guy is very polite and genuine banda hai. He works in many another RO companies but the he also assured about vguard product and service. This RO is good with very cheap annual service charge compared to other brands.
"after too much searching, finally bought it and it was a very good decision. the water is very good and taste is also good. the build quality and the service by ao smith is very quick and easy, would decinitely recommend"
"After use 3 long days , I am filling product is very good."
After using 10days I am giving this rating.Nice product in less budget
After using 6months I am writing this review.I am from Mumbai and we are using this product from last 6-7months. Within 6-7 months we found that filers was clog and you have to replace filter cost of filter is 2000 rupees. company is not taking any warranty of products.Ideally Mumbai have clean water still filters are clog.so I will.not recommend it.Amazon service team is also not taking any responsibility so guys don't purchase this product..you will face problem bycot amazon
After using it for more than a month.Water quality and taste is very good.TDS adjusting is best.Customer support and installation team is good.The product was delivered on time and then installation process was smooth. Working fine till date. Value for money.
After using many months..it's working charm..
After using one Month I am Writing the review the product is good and upto mark for family the RO and the sediment filter with copper technology is good and TDS adjustment also good.
"After using one month, my first OR, Nice product and Good service, Thank you 😀"
After using this product for 6months I feel this is the best one. We have been searching for good stainless steel water purifier with hot water. And this is our superb choice.Reason for 4 instead of 5:It's not user friendly at first and when power cut you cannot use this RO
"After using this product for last three months, I am posting my fair review.Its a very nice product in such a price band of ₹5,000.Ease of installation. Water taste is good and hassle free performance. Little bit noisy but adjustable.."
"alaline water, hot water dispensing, design"
Alkaline feature is I think only in name.not in actual.Service charges for installation is very high.
Alkaline filter and filter indicator options are useful for us
Alkaline water & feature of hot water. So far good. I am happy with product
Alkaline water hot warn water instant very Good
"All desired features like RO, UV, Mineraliser, Goodness of Copper etc. in pocket friendly budget. Aesthetically nice."
All details were explained by Technician.  Good filter.
All filter changes done by satish muugan.
All functions are good
All good
"All good, thanks"
All is good but storage size is not enough for big family.
All Is. Well.
"All other brands giving warranty for filters too but Pureit is not giving  they are excluded  filters, earlier it was therePlease think before buying it !"
All plastic difficult to install filter go for a branded product this is not good
All products in inside are local thy are not working
All the required parts were not delivered
All was good the only thing is the installation guy does not carried the tds meter to verify the filtered water tds
All went well
"All what you need from R.O you found it with this R.O , fast , pure"
Already tap is leaking and water drops are visible inside the purifier cartridges
"Although product had some defects, it was swiftly replaced with new item and installed"
"Always breaking down, as well as regular maintenance GKK 1/2 is very costly. Quite a headache. Much better to go for basic RO."
Always some or the other issues. Please don't buy the product
Am writing this review after seeing the performance more than a month.Satisfied with quality and performance.on time installation and good support.Overall it is recommended this'll be best one to buy under the budget.
Amar mishra did very excellent work.
Amazing design and better than other purifiers of its range
Amazing design and the performance is good.
Amazing feature with normal affordable ratesFast servicing and quick installation
Amazing Product
Amazing product at an amazing cost. Worth buyingGood features and easy to use.Support and installation team is great as well.
Amazing product for this price
Amazing product with easy installation from Livpure Team❤❤
Amazing service
"amazing service from shahal . he is very polite , well behave . thank you v guard"
Amazon delivered in a day..and installation done within 12 hrs ....and it's working fine
"Amazon delivered the product on time , but Eureka Forbes have pathetic after sales services. My order was delivered on 13th Feb , but despite several installation requests , it is still not Installed.So saddened with their attitude."
Amc is good
Among the Best available under counter water purifier
An excellent product that has surpassed expectations. Hassle free installation and operation. Definitely a must buy.
Anandhu insulation was very good
Anandhu the Technician had done his job perfectly
Annual Maintenance cost is 6500inr.All filters must be replaced once in year.
Annual maintenance cost is exhorbitant. Its more than 5500. Better to buy a new product after one year. Costing more than the water purifier. It took two days to install. Not very interesting. Dont go for this product.
"Any other big electronics I purchased on Amazon, I have seen issues, this is the satisfied one which I got. Worth the cost. Water taste in this place is really bad, but now really happy with the water taste I get through the filters. It has lovable look, standard one. May be leakages can be expected, once happened but later dint see."
Anyone buying this has to change gkk filter frequently that’s not the problem but the problem is that the service person will not come to change it if you book your service today you have to wait till a month or two months but that’s not guaranteed that they will come to change after few days the filter stops working till you change the filter it won’t start be aware that this is a nice product but after sale service is the worst so choose wisely by not choosing this
AO Purifier is excellent
AO smith have replaced the unit after couple of months
AO Smith installation and service was fantastic! The product is suitable for making TDS water safe for drinking. Very happy with the product.
AO smith one of best purifier working so good automated Thanks
"AO Smith Water Filter under the Sink it's too Good & Technical, Installation Team & Customer Care Team were very supportive & done excellent work"
"AO Smith water purifiers are top-notch when it comes to delivering clean and safe drinking water. The multi-stage filtration process ensures that contaminants like chlorine, sediment, heavy metals, and bacteria are effectively removed, leaving you with water that's not just pure but also tastes great. The build quality is durable, and the design is sleek and modern, fitting seamlessly into any kitchen. Plus, the after-sales service and support from AO Smith are commendable, ensuring a hassle-free experience for consumers. Overall, AO Smith water purifiers are a reliable choice for anyone looking for high-quality water purification solutions."
AO Smiths filters have been around for some time now and have created a Niche Space for itself for providing safe water in an affordable way . Was so satisfied that I did go in for a second machine this year and hope they continue to deliver on its word .Way to go .
AOSmith's Z9 is a very good product for drinking water purification.
Appointment was taken promptly and installed efficiently. There was water leakage issue after 3 hours of installation. Small valve got replaced next day promptly.
Appropriate service for the product
"Aqua D Pure impresses with its remarkable balance of affordability and top-notch quality. As a budget-friendly option, it stands out in providing exceptional value without compromising on performance. The water it produces boasts a refreshing taste, free from impurities, ensuring a healthy hydration experience. With Aqua D Pure, you get the assurance of clean, pure water at a fraction of the cost of other brands. It's a smart choice for those seeking both economy and excellence in their hydration solutions."
Aqua D Pure is a not a good choice for RO water because no proper service for repairs and also built quality is poor.
Aqua d pure is truly nice product.after received this product within 24 hours engineer was perfectly installed the RO.its water quality is so good.thanks to aqua d pure.
"Aqua D water purifier is an excellent drinking water filtration system. I was researching alkaline water with minerals and this is the best one! The water tastes so refreshing, tea and coffee are richer in flavor and much deeper in color, and cooked vegetables and rice retain their flavors. Our skin feels softer and is clearer. We find we enjoy drinking and cooking with the water, and since it is alkaline, we drink when we are thirsty and feel satisfied. We love it! Installation team was very helpful and answered all of my questions – honestly and promptly. Thank you for giving wonderful water purifier at such a affordable price"
Aqua grand tap is missing
Aqua guard water purifier is good product working fine and installation was good
Aquad pure filter was in good quality and installed very smoothly service was good
"Aquadpure ro water filter  ,  I order aquadpure on last week Delivery  and installation was done as on now it work properly . For the performances we have wait , taste wise it's good"
Aquagard is the best water purifier in the market.working well.Looks good and Taste better. 👍🏻
Aquagaurd's assurance with elegant design... it is a very good product... hassel free and up to the mark...
Aquaguard aura is the best purifier in this range. Great features and the TDS is in good range 70-100 after purification.
Aquaguard charges you 6000 rs with filter change for every 6000 litres. Adding up the initial cost of 15+ k even you are paying 1.5 RS per litre for atleast next 10 years. But live pure smart rentals gives you 1000 litres for 800 odd rupeesWhich is half the expense. Also no hassle of maintenance.Better go for rentals. Planning to sell it off.
Aquaguard marvel nxt is really good. Delivery serivice and product installation is all good. I'm satisfied with this product and service
Aquaguard will always out-perform and im reqlly happy about it
Around 10 days ago i ordered this water filter from Amazon.Amazon ia good brand name. The product i recd was also looking fine. After 2-3days after installation problem has come with some defective electronic part .I called a person involved he promised me  to replace the defective part soon but after so many days of waiting there is no replacement.So with this bitter experience i donot recommend this product to any one interested.POOR SERVICE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT 0/5 FROM MY SIDE.NVR EXPECTED THIS FROM AMAZON AND EUREKA FORBES.
As a prime customer of Amazon.fasle YouTube review.never buy that product.make fake promises about product.no customer care support.no responsibility to installation.headche after buy
As I discussed with Livpure it's works to 2000 tds level after that I purchased but in my area 17000 tds & RO having maintenance only 250 tds level at last this information provided by service person & he told it's not going below .
As mention 1+3 year free service.I log tow time call for service but no service done first time and call close. Sencond time i raised agin sevice call still waiting from 72 Hr for services.
As of now i am writing review 4 days using this product.Product is good.. Happy with one day delivery with prime...Come to design it's very unique and beautiful as shown in picture...Build quality is good...Half star reduce for storage capacity as mentioned 7 ltr but it's give only 6.5 ltr.Another half star reduce for installation service is late.About HUL service is late after delivery installation done at 3rd day...as HUL mentioned within 24 hr installation which is dispointinting....
As of now looks good but need to wait how it turns out to be in coming days..Good buy I would say.
"As of now product is good.  But installation was charged , it should be free from the company as it is taken by the first time. In future any further issues should be taken care by ourselves."
As of now the product is working absolutely fine. We shall recommend to buy it.
As per expectation.
As per specification and Proper installation
As per the installation request Vgurd aqua RO installation was done and completed on the required time. Good service by VGuard
As per the price product is good. 👍🏻
"As seen in the picture ,working good"
As soon as electricity goes away the product is inoperable
As there AMC service not good. Facing lot of issues. I frustrated this Eureka Forbes services. No one serious from company as well as customer care side. No money values. In short this is a froud company and there services. I got my service after 45 day's from the request call. During that period I called customer care to 35+ then I got service i.e. in 45 days.
"As there is no customer support for Urban Company products, you have to deal on your own with Installation, repairs and maintenance.They don’t even have a customer care number.Urban Company won’t be responding to emails either. What’s the use of having warranty.Irrespective of warranty"
"As this is trusted brand, but I can say the Kent has a professional service team! Installation was done on my right available time. Team even works on Sundays! Distributor service coordinator staff is also supportive."
Asam... Good product excellent 👍👍👌👌
Aswm purchase the quality is very good
"At begining it was nice for two weeks, after that when the water stopped passing througu membrane filter on bottom. Cleaning the membrane filter is almost impossible to clean with the given syringe and the filter never returned to its original condition. Even though we clean it for two times a week the purification is very very slow."
At comfortable offer aquaguard ro is best to use for bore well water. Must buy.
"At first it worked completely fine but after 1st free servicing it stopped working suddenly.. Called technical again but he was unable to fix it. Total 3 technical were assigned for the job to fix The Filter but none of them were able to do that. I called multiple times to the service centre and escalate the issue but no one even bother to fix this. Still is on warranty period. I purchased it on last September but after couple of months it stopped working.I was assured by the service centre that they will replace the product. it's been 1 month and we are having tap water to drink. No response we are getting from the company. They are misguiding us keep telling product is on the way .But they are changing their commitment on every single day.I am helpless now . Even those technicals are not picking my calls. It's a scam. I wasted my hard earned money on this.Requesting you all, don't go to purchase this product otherwise you will suffer like me.Even the product is not eligible in any sort of rating"
At first the technician checked the water quality and said no issue with water quality and we can use only one filterBut after 3 months of buying the aquaguard the machine stopped workingThe technician visited after 3 days from the date of complaint and said the water is muddy need to install two filtersAnd the service is worst in eureka forbesEven after raising a complaint or escalation no one will respond on time Worst service
"At the time of installation we found that the power supply conductor of RO was not working, The installation service was not good, after 5,6 calls your service partner came to install the RO."
At this cost nice filter
At this cost With this specification really great. Water taste good but not expect can water taste. This ro will added minerals so the tase is different and good. After installation 1wk I put this review. Really worth product
At this price point it's justifies every feature provided as per the description and look wise the designs are very pleasing and suites the interior of the kitchen.
At this price what else we can expect from water purifier. It works great. Performing very well with very high TDS inlet water also. Just blindly go for it
Aura is working perfectly and the water has stable TDS and tastes good.
Auto cut after water filling is not available.

Bad
Bad service
BAD SERVICE AND WATER LEAKING FROM PRODUCT.
Bad service. Service people are only interested in making you spend on parts. And problem started in 3 months.The water flow is slow and the service people say that parts have yo be replaced. How can a new water filter have problems this early.
Bad support
Bad vankathinga
Bahut achaa hai
Bahut hi kharab products hai koi service shi nhi hai it's very bad koi bhi na purchase kre isko not good
Bakwaas product total lost of investment
"Basic model for those who get corporation water and don’t need RO filteringDoes it’s work , basic and efficient- don’t expect more"
"Been using aquaguard since 2007, always reliable service and great products. This filter meets expectations and looks good too"
"Been using for 2 months.Doesn't lower TDS.In the initial 15 days, Purified water TDS will be higher than water inlet TDS. But it will settle eventually."
Been using it for 3 weeks now. Purifier is working nicely. Taste of the water is really good. Installation was prompt within 1 day.
Been Using it since 3 months overall a great product for using under the kitchen platform
"Been using one for so long, got another one. Installation is great"
"Been using the product for 15 days. No complaints, works wonderfully well"
Been using this for more than 20 days it's a nice product.
Been using this for the past 3 months. No issues so far. Does the job well.
"Before buying have a doubt for quality at this price. But after 6 months of using, my money is not waste. Very good product, go for it."
"Before buying please check if there is a good service center around your area & then only proceed to buy because if there is none then you're going to regret buying this like me. I have been waiting for a service person since a week & even calling multiple times & mailing them now I'm not getting even a response from the company. The after sales service of Aquaguard is the worst, our local vendors will do a good job then them. There is also issues with the upper lid. Even though it looks it's tight it's is not, if you have ants in ypur house then ants will find its way in it. You can get better r.o in this budget. Don't go for this brands name."
"Before I am not used faber product it's working I will update the product review after few days, For Installation I called the faber customer care, next day they done the installation and explained all details,"
"Being an unknown brand i still ordered it based on customer reviews. But when i called their customer care number to ask about the installation , no one answered, I tried calling them several times but no answer. I even tried to get a response through their 'contact us' form on their official website but still didnt get a response. Hence i cancelled ny order. If they are so unreliable before the purchase imagine how they will act once i buy their product. Better buy from a known and reliable brand like Kent or Livpure or other known brand , they might cost more but you can be assured to have safe drinking water for your family"

Best Part is Hot Water Feature. Hot water access should be made at a click which we have to wait for some time and by default is child locked to prevent burns. Other features and ease of operations is best.

Best value for money product and good support..
Best Water Filter
Best water purifier
Best Water purifier in budget price
"Best water purifier is the only word that I can say as it reduced TDS from 1000 to 70, and made the water more alakaline by changing the value from 9 to 13, and most importantly made the water less oxidant by reducing the ORP level, which helps in making our cells live healthier for long time"
Best water purifier it's working very well and good looking it's 13 litres capacity in best rate
Best water purifier under the price range. Fully satisfied.
Best Water purifier!!
"Better filtering when compared to market leaders, only gripe was it was missing a diverter valve in package according to AO Smith installation executive. Fortunately huge was able to use the old part from previous RO filter which I was replacing it with."
"Better to buy good brand water purifier. I am getting impurities like sand particles along with water. TDS is another issue which is fluctuating more. Application is also not reflecting the TDS the same as measured by myself, you can see the clear difference."
Bhot badiya service v guard ki taraf se bhot fast service. I am very impressed as the installation guy came within 12 hours of delivery of the product.
Bilkul bhi mat Lena ..Bahut problem aa rahi hai
"Bit pricy, in range of Rs. 15000+Good quality water.Needs separate filter too."
Booked the service but didn't get any response. Pathetic experience with this brand. I strongly wouldn't recommend anyone to buy any product of Eureka as service is very poor.
Bought before one month till now working great and taste of the water was excellent...
bought it bcz of excellent after sale service provided by Havells.
"Bought it in Nov '23 and as of writing it in January '24, it has already broken down twice. The initial installation took 3 visits from the agent to install. First agent was extremely rude and inept. Second agent came the second day and installed it with some leakages. He then came the third day to fix it. But it again broke down in Dec where we had to call the customer support to get it fixed. Now, it's January and it has broken down again. The lights start flashing and no water comes out. The customer service takes about a week to send someone to fix it. Good luck to you on arranging alternate water sources during that time."
"Bought six months back, No issues till now, working as expected."
Bought the product from Amazon. Ontime delivery and the installation from Eureka Forbes is awesome.Happy with the product.
"Bought this but the installation person didn't come on time, kept pushing the time until I said I'll just get Urban Company to do it.He showed up late and installed it then pushed me for an immediate review on Amazon which I refused.The RO started leaking and hasn't stopped for a day. I called the person a few hours after and he promised to visit the next day, which he hasn't up till now.Calling Urban Company now, very poor after sales"
"Bought this in March 2020 and bought Kent Supreme in Sept 2020. Both are plugged in different home and appartment.•The cost of maintaining Pureit is about 12-15k per year which Kent costs me about 5k at most.•Pureit service charge is ₹350. Kent is ₹250.•Pureit customer service needs to call 10 times before they come, Kent only needs one call or appointment from the app.•Kent guy will check water ph level, run water though the membranes to clean them and change sedimentary filter as service. Purit guy will change sedimentary filter and done.I live in metro city and see the difference in customer service very clearly. I highly recommend against pureit. Don't buy from them."
"Bought this product after I got tired of Aquaguard lax service attitude. The purifier itself is fine. It does it job well like any other purifier. I dont think there is an alkalizer because ph of water is more or less same compared to tap. What matters is when things go wrong, how long service takes to fix it. Two instances where I had issues were fixed within a day. I hope service remains consistent even if paid because thats the only thing that matters with a water purifier."
"Bought this product in Jul 2023, worked well for 3-4 months. After that constantly this purifier is not functioning. It filters out water in drops, it takes an entire day to fill in 3-4 liters.Customer service is not responsive. They only know to sell their services, without actually providing service. Within 8-9 months, technician asked to renew AMC (with new cartridge) of Rs.2200 and purchase a pre-filter of Rs.1300. I waited 10 days only to hear back that they still don't have the prefilter. And they were suggesting me to buy AMC for 3 years! Don't fall in the trap.I'm throwing away this product now after 10 months, Rs.7000 is waste. Warranty is useless."
Bought this product thinking Kent is a good company. Started to malfunction after few months. Contacted their customer support. They will saythey are sending people to repair but no one will show up. Waited more than a week for service guy to show and they never did. Fed up with their service. Even my friend faced similar issue with same product.Please be cautious when you buy. Don't repeat my mistake
Bought this to replace earlier PureIt Ultima which was giving some trouble after more than 8years of good service. Opted for PureIt by choice primarily due to very good service experience over the years… thankfully the same experience continued with the installation of this new device.
Broke down in 1 month just waste of moneyDo not buy because company do not help you in warranty period as well
Brought during GIF.. Product is working fine till date.
Brought NF-80Input TDS: 400 to 600 rangeOutput TDS: 90 to 160Better than ROWater taste goodUV chamber in right directionCustomer Support is good
"Brought this product last month, water taste good. Would recommend the product."
"Brought V-Guard Zenora water purifier from Amazon. After one year it started leaking from inside. Called V-Guard customer care. Though, I received technician phone number from customer care. He never turned out even after repeated calls. Finally, the filter stopped Functioning. Thereafter, we called a local technician who found out that the board got short circuited. He adviced us to discard the product. Based on it we exchanged the product online on offer and brought another brand. Never buy V-Guard."
budget friendly Filter with Various Purification Steps And Fully Automatic Ro Purifier.
Budget friendly product with great features and services.  Timely delivered and installation service is also good.
Budget friendly purifier but buy only when TDS is already good or below 100
Budget friendly water purifier and hassle free installation. Customer care is very responsive and helpful. Better compared to other water purifiers.
Build quality is also good
build quality is good as compare to price.taste is also good and value for money.lets see some more time
Built quality is very bad and not sure how to claim warranty and installation support from customer service.
But doesn't work if you don't have power.
"But water tap in annoying, didn't like it."
But you need to buy one aditional filter too it's very light but overall good
Buy RO from Eurka only. very good product at affordable rate
"BY LOOKS THE PRODUCT LOOKS GOOD . BUT IN FUNCTION THE FILTERED WATER DELIVERY IS VERY VERY SLOW. AFTER A DROP FALLS THE NEXT DROP FALL TAKES 48 SECONDS. ON CONTACTING THE COMPANY THEY SAY THAT FOR THIS FILTER THEY DONT DEPUTE ANY TECHNICIAN  EVEN FOR INSTALLATION. IN MY CASE WITHIN 10 DAYS OF DELIVERY/PROCUREMENT THROUGH AMAZON THEY ONLY PROVIDED  ADDRESS OF 2 DEALERS MORE THAN 30 KM AWAY WHEREAS I AM STAYING IN AURBANIZED & WELL POPULATED AREA OF VISAKHAPATNAM (CLASS- B1 CITY ) so, far my problem is not attended,."
"By seeing brand name Pureit, I purchased this RO in Jan 2024, delivery late, installation late, leakage problem also rectified after so many complaints. I don't know in future, how I'll face problem for filter change."
"Can sense cheap quality in every part.You would have to replace all the filters in the first 6 months.The package came with most of the parts unassembled, this is to make it hard to install so that the buyer is forced to call their customer care for installation"
Cheating by paying 1100 rupees
"Chinese product all Indian product give this. It's new company which give other Indian company give you.It's list of money, don't by this product."
Chip quality
Clear water after filter not much change in taste.Only this is would be better if one more stage was there where we could pour water and wait for filter rather than filling slowly.
"Comes with premium quality candles and is better than locally available ones. It is filled with granular carbon and you can shake the candle to see. Suitable for chennai metro water which has tds of about 250. No chlorine smell and water tastes neutral post filtration. Filtration rate is around 1 litres per hour for 2 new candles, should become slow after it starts clogging. We are filling it twice a day. If you have kids, just boil the filtered water for additional safety. Over all happy with the quality."
Compact size & looks beautiful in the kitchen. Excellent product
"Compare to other products its correct prize and cost, only thing is installment cost and visiting cost need to reduce little-bit, installment cost is fine its offering by others, taste nice... Rating for this product 4 out of 5.Need to continue service for customers."
Compatible for usageGood service by Dhanigasalam
complain is there parts of filter are not of good quality . Requesting you if possible replace candle or nut bolts of candle  of the water filter as nut bolts of one candle of filter is not working.Thanks and regardsVijayanti
Complete cheating on the app. App shows 56 excellent TDS and actual is 9 to 21. Due to which my kids are having throat pains and stomach pains from 2 months..
"Complete waste of money. There is no water filter in it. Just UV that cannot be maintained or cleaned. What's the use of water purification device, that does not change taste and storage chamber cannot be cleanedReplacement is pending from 3 months"
Completed
Completely happy with their product and service
"Completely value for money,excellent customer support from Amazon and Aqua D RO & the field agent who fixed mine.I recommending to all buyers don't give money to other big brand's when you have Aqua D RO. Try once won't be regret."
Convenient to use with toucb function. Child lock was a good option.Installation was done by experience technician.Purifier works well for bore water also the Water feels good to drink.
Cool and installed quickly and good service
Coplicated to install
Cost and design much more impressive
Cost efficient and very easy to Install & use
"Cost of maintenance is very high. For the first year it will work fine but after that you will have to pay for the filters to be changed every six months and needless to say it will cost half the amount of the filter itself, not worth it."
Crystal clear water taste is also good we like the product
Crystal clear water.
Currently this product is working good
Customer like the quality test and filter of the water purifier. for example they mention that is a good product the water test is also good and the filtration process is great. they appreciate the value and service
Customer service good and nice products
"Customers like the quality, taste and value of the water purifier. They mention that it works well, produces excellent performance and is worth the price."
"Customers like the value, ease of installation, service, appearance and taste of the water purification unit. For example, they mention it's the best budgeting RO purifier, the filteration works well and the taste is good. They appreciate the quality."
D product was good n it works perfectly so far..Installation was done on d day of arrival itself..
Damage float switch coming
"Damage product is delivered,"
Damage product received
Damaged UV filter
"Dear Team AO Smith, how do you justify TDS level being prefix set at 35-40 in Indian market.This is like drinking distril water. It would be great to hear from you people on the post."
Decent priced
Defective product as top cover is not inside the box
Defective product received. Very bad experience with the urban company. Worst customer support. After long follow up with the company the technician came and installed and not working. Returned the product. Not at all recommended. Dot go with reviews.
Delivered and installed on time. Everything went well. Arul kumar was professional and offered suggestions to help us to understand more about the water purifier and explained the funtions.
"Delivered in nicely packaged box within 4 days of order. Installation technician was prompt to install and show the performance. Next day, on call he  again visited to adjust TDS of water. Filter is working well but only four days have passed.  Very good product in this price range. Of course long term performance is yet to be seen."
Delivered in time and Installation is also smooth.
"Delivered in time.product is well packaged,unharmed. Satisfied regarding the information given and it's working nicely as expected....."
Delivery partner is too good and install very nicely.service is very nyc
"Delivery was on time ,  installation was done by the company , water test good."
"Delivery was on time and smooth installation. Write this after One month of use, tatse is good.Product works properly."
Demo explained very nice product
Design attractive and quality is decent
Design function look & it’s durability.Excellent for municipal corporation water.
Design is good and filtration speed is good  only TDS controller is missing overall value for money product.
Design of the product is nice and very easy to use. It was installed by technician in a proper manner.
Detailed demo done with proper installation done with consideration of placement
Device is functional without any issues. I am waiting this review after 4 months. So far so good.One feedback for the product development would be to increase the length of the power cord.
Device is good looking
Device looking good and working fine
Dff
Did have initial issue with the installation team in Kolkata - but later the matter was resolved and the water purifier is doing well now and works seamlessly
"Did not fit the purifier properly. I called him to come back and fit, but no response from the technician. Not satisfied with the Product."
"Did not get response from service personal for installation,  so personally installed the unit, everything was in the package, its working fine and water quality is good."
"Did you know that the definition of warranty means the technician would come and clean your system periodically and it does not pertain to any mechanical breakdown or part malfunction. Did you know you have to pay exorbitant money just to replace some defective part even though the said product is under warranty. Did you know without their 3.5 K gold AMC you cannot get your parts replaced even though it's under warranty. Well according to Ms. Shreyasi warranty means service and not repair and replacement. Hence the next time you plan of buying a water filter please keep the above points in mind and choose aquaguard products at your on discretion..Company is here to fleece you off your hard earned, so if you r willing to submit to their definitions and jargons please feel free to join our community.."
"Difficult to use, not as expected"
Dislike
Dislike cheat customer
"Dispatch time, value for money"
Dnt buy...
Do not buy Aquaguard. Big NO. Their service is too bad so that it will not resolve for months. You will keep calling and raising service requests but no one bothers about it. It’s very frustrating. You have buy water from outside for long durations even though you have AMC.
Do not buy at more than 6.5k.
Do not buy this product it’s very bad there are lot of gaps in which cockroaches can easily enter and lay there eggs …. Very bad experience
"Do not buy thus RO , problem is not with RO , main problem is with their service , I brought it around 10 months back , in that time frame it had stopped working 3 times , they are telling its PCB problem everytime , so then they will order new PCB , and it will take around 1 to 1.5 months can take upto 2 months for that PCB to arrive. as they have shortage of parts . and if you do want to buy bottled water paying 20rs per litre every day for 1 to 2 months then go for this RO , the reason I am writing this review  is my RO again stopped  working  yesterday  , and I am fed up of this RO , if they won't fix it in 2-3 days I am going to file a case in consumer court"
Do not use Eureka Forbes product because they do not have good customer service.I purchased 6000/- per year AMC service but I am not getting any kind of service..  And none of the brand representative is willing to resolve my complaint....... I guess this will not happen to anyone in future.  I AM AMAZONS PRIME MEMBER CUSTOMER.
Does its job very well. I have added the sediment and iron filter.
"Does not waste much water as RO filter. Depending on source water TDS, the membrane filter can be changed.Service is good.Annual maintenance cost comes around 3k"
Does not work
Doesn’t deserve even single star. The item became defective within 15 days of installation. Customer service of the company is very pathetic. They are indirectly denying the warranty claim also.
Doesn't make sound at all.
"Doing this review after 3 months. Product works well, the service team is also very responsive. Installation was smooth."
"Don’t even think of buying this product. I’ve purchased their product and suffering because of their service. My UV filter is not working in my purifier and I’ve filed a complain. Even after taking their AMC, they are not responding.Worst experience ever."
Don’t take AMC. As after AMC no service request will be entertained.products substandard.service very bad. I am buying water due to non functional Aquagaurd for last 5 days
Don”t buy this ptoduct this also required local extra outer filter then why we spend extra money
Done
Done madhu good work
Dont buy any product from Euraka Forbes. My water filter stopped working after 7 months after purchase. I have registered service request through coustomer care no response Evening after 20 from complent registeration.
"Don't buy any product manufactured by Kent, they are scamming us only."
Don't buy it. You need to clean  membrane frequently otherwise it will be very slow filtering. Only if you are single then only it can filter water sufficient for your daily consumption.
Don't buy it's totally poor quality waste of money
"Don't buy this inside local filter was putting i change that 2500rs, for my emargency i losses 2500rs, can you return my charges i will change review."
"Dont buy this product go for any other purifier you would have peace of mind, no customer service , you will have issues daily with the device and have to spend your time weeks of it following up on in mail, call and money in top up as the customer care number is not toll-free"
"Don't buy this product within 3 months the board went failure, had to change the board and it cost 950rs"
"Don't buy this product, first 3 months there will be no issues..after 3 months one by one issues starts but there is no proper response from the service team as well as manufacturer.Recently I faced one issue.. my machine got automatically stopped and then I have raised a complaint, after that service man told we need to change all the filters within 3 months. One of my other friend also have faced same issues. So as per my observation please don't buy this product anymore"
"Don't buy this product, nothing is covered under warranty as well Maha ghatiya product every 15-20 days required services. also inside lite gone"
Don't buy this product. It's totally worst prodect . Service provider not working in villages😞. Air problem every time service not good
Dont buy this product. Local is better then branded. 3rd class service
"Don't buy this product..Actually I have ordered 13 litre RO, whereas i received 10 litre (mentioned in the box) machine, but it actually stored only 7 litres.Most importantly water taste is utter waste..Water purification filter seems not working, corporation water directly pour in the box."
Don't buy waste of moneyDon't buy waste of money and time
"Dont buy, No installation since a week & no phone callls for installation by technician!"
"Don't buy, worst product, installation next hour start problem waste water not flowing, the service person came and clear the problem, then next 2 hour tds level showing 15,  cheap quality product, poor service, please don't waste your money on this product...."
Don't buy.
Dont buy. Very bad delivery experience.
Don't ever purchase this worst product from AO Smith. Product started leaking and overflowing within 3 months of purchase. Multiple parts changed by service engineers but issue persisted.
Dont go for it. In one year gave maintenance worth 6500/-
Don't go to higher priced purifiersThis model is best in all the ways
Dont invest 17000 for this kind of product its over priced and some time smell ll come from water
Don't purchase because livepure worst service. They didn't care after sell
Don't purchase I have been thinking of buying new one
Don't purchase Proven Products as they are of low Quality & also not safe...Does not do make good quality water also faces stomach pain after drinking...If Amazon replacement dates goes then they won't provide You the replacement of the product even if the product is danaged...So Proven products are not good for Your Health & after sale service is very bad & poor...Not valid for even single Star rating
Dont purchase this RO from this seller. The RO delivered to me had bad filters installed because of which TDS was coming very high. Tried to reach to the seller on the number shared in the description but no one answered.
dont take any products of faber even someone gift you as free of cost as serice and parts are tootooooooooo mcuh costly and experiance with technicians are worst as they damange the instruments on they callled SERICE BUT AFTER THAT U HAVE TO PAY HIGE AMONT FOR DAMAGE INSTRUMENT SO PLS PLS PLS DO NOT BUY AT ANY COST EVEN ZERO COST DONT
Don't want any more
Dont waste money useless no one came for installation no guarantee.
"Don't waste your money in buying this product. It is worst machine. The day it was installed, it is not working properly.. Water is leaking... Installation and service is very poor.."
"Doubt that seller has sent returned product to us,user manual is missing when asked information installation guy didn’t gave proper response .Product is working but still seller should mention about product and its history."
Drinking water
Drinking water is clean
Durability
"During the installation the technician asked me it is important to rate the product 5 stars on Amazon. Good thing I didn’t do it.Just a month after the technician installed my new water purifier it started steaming. Which was odd and then the transparent plastic started to crack. I called the technician again and they came over cleaned it up and it stopped steaming ever since.Now when I asked them to change the transparent plastic they say that it’s impossible for it to break on it’s on, it’s not covered in warranty and that you punched the plastic which is why it started steaming…it’s been 3 months now since that technician visited and it hasn’t steamed once. Making his statement that the steam was caused after the plastic broke false.Worst product… worst experience not recommended. I have to live with it now since 11k is worth more to me"
"Earlier I brought pure it water purifier that was very costly and I had to install extra motor for the same. This kinsco water purifier is very affordable comes with single inside motor, installation was on time easy to use no noise at all and working awesome.Thank you kinsco highly recommend ✌️"

Ensure your water supply TDs and the. Buy else if the product looks stylish in kitchen and is easy to installLoved the look and taste
Eureka Forbes had earlier gifted things with a new product. This seems to have stopped
Eureka Forbes is a reputed brand I was hoping for a best service. But the installation guy called to inform that we have to make an additional purchase of ₹1750/- to install. And claiming that the warranty will be void if we didn’t listen to him.My question is that why those details are not mentioned in the seller’s landing page before ?Why they advertise the product for hard water but they need additional installation to work?Bluestar purifier worked for 5 years without major services is far more better than this.
"Eureka Forbes is a scam. I went to their website to book a demo, but they didn't provide any demonstration. Instead, they gave false information about their product. I bought the Nova Alkaline filter. The person who installed the filter did not set the TDS properly. Additionally, the pH of the water purifier was over 8.5, which is harmful to health. Despite repeated emails to support, no one has come to solve the pH issue. Avoid buying any product from Eureka Forbes."
Eureka Forbes service is good and quickInstillation
Eureka forbes will provide zero service and support incase of any concerns. Beware! My case hasn’t been resolved since 10 days.
"Even after 10 days of delivery, installation is not done after 10 calls and escalations to service center. AO Smith service center is worst among all companies so please think before you buy their products."
"Even after 7 hours,only 25 % of water is filtered.Useless productNo customer care or service provider number is available.Hence I don't know what to do now ?"
"Even after first itself the motor and the filter unit was not working, informed many times with support team, still not response"
Even after following up for a month no response from service team. They are canceling all the service request raised without any work done. Please do not buy any product from Eureka
"Even after prompt delivery by #Amazon, there is no information on installation by the Brand for 4 days. There number is unreachable. #Eureka Forbes #worst service"
Even though the product price is less the quality it offers is good
"Ever since I bought the product, it is working great...I am satisfied with it.You guys also buy this, this is what I will say."
Every filter leaking.They never seem to test before packing.Waste of money.I would rather give zero stars.Don't buy this useless product.
"Every month it's needed to repair even for navi mumbai municipal water quality.Poor,frustrating service by eureka. Technician will visit more than 1 week after registering complaint ..There are leakage issues with this filter"
Everyone should have..
Everything is fine
Everything is fine. Did not receive the power adapter and water bottle in box. Refund requested for the power adapter. Not sure why they didn't send me the water bottle it looks really cool though 😅😅😅
Everything is good
"Everything is great about this purifier except the pressure of the tap, which could have been better. Have seen some under counter purifiers with better pressure.NOTE: It wastes a lot of water but that is again a feature of many RO+UV and is not their major selling point."
Everything is perfect
Everything is perfect.
Everything is super. It would be great if it also worked during power cut.
Everything seems to be out of place

Exelient
Exlent product good it's work good
Exlent product it working very good. Water  taste Is very good like mineral water
Expected better products and service from Forbes. It worked for sometime and stopped. They installed a 3500 pump saying pressure is low and now they say that pump is not enuf.Worst thing is attitude of the service guy ...did not care and just went away without doing anything...EUREKA Forbes was FAMOUS for good products and service and this is the worst
Expertly installed by a knowledgeable technician
"Extremely disappointed with the customer service. Bought a water purifier that stopped working after just 4 days. Despite reaching out to their service team countless times, there's been no response. It's been over 3 months, and still no resolution. Frustrated with their poor management. Shame on you for such a pathetic product and an even worse service team."
Extremely poor service support
Extremely satisfied.
Faber installation water purifier done ✅✅
"Faber Neutron pro RO + UV + MAT +Copper Guard + PH Enhancer, 10lts, Suitable Upto 2500 TDS.This review after using this water filter for 8months1.spares parts are too costly inside membrane cost 2500rs and other filters cost each 6002.in 8 months filter breakdown 5times every time no explanationThink before buy after warranty expires one cannot maintain this filter due to expensive spare parts."

"Fast purification, low wastage of water"
"Fast water purification process, fills tank in no time. Looks elegant and stylish. Recommended."
Fault in one of the filters. Have lodged 3 complaints since march 23rd but no response. I have been buying water from market
Features mentioned are good
Feel free to purchase
Few issues:1. Water cant be dispensed if there is no electricity2. No cup/bottle holder or stand to place the glass while filling
Filter
Filter for home
"Filter good for the price ,In fact we can't feel the mineral water taste"
Filter is good but the plastic tap breaks in just 10 uses.
"Filter is really good, storage is good too. Installation guy came on time and installed the product very quickly"
"Filter is really good, storage is good too..But when I checked for TDS in purified water its around 38 which is not recommended. TDS should be 50-150 which is excellent for drinking. Raised a complaint with technician and they were not sure about this.Only option they gave was return of the product.Except TDS issue everything is good so far."
"Filter is working fine. Great product, value for money."
Filter very slowly
Filter was supposed to be installed on 26th March 10.after 2 days I am told that they can't provide services in my area(HP). ONLY 3rd party service provider will come. And then later on I was told by the customer executive that the service provider is denying to install. So I m returning the product wondering how they will give service in future.
"Filtration is good, but some black colour of plastic/rubber particles comes in below compartmentSo replaced the candles but same issue for other one as well"
Fine product. Working well. Under budget and low price in comparison to other products. Thanks kinsco.
Finishing not good
"First of all Installation was pathetic and unsatisfactory and technician said he forgot to bring pre-outer filter, which need to be paid and bought from the service provider.I had less expectations for the HAVELLS Aqua Water Purifier,thought its brand and will do purification to use it for my home.Unfortunately, my experience has been far from satisfactory.Product Performance:The purifier frequently malfunctioned, failing to consistently provide clean and safe drinking water.The taste and clarity of the water were not up to the mark, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the filtration system.Customer Service:Whenever I raise service requests through HAVELLS sync app, the dealer cancels it and not attends the call.My attempts to resolve these issues through customer service were not met unhelpful support.Despite multiple service visits, the problems persisted, leaving me frustrated with the lack of resolution.Conclusion:Based on my experience, I cannot recommend the HAVELLS Aqua Water Purifier to anyone.The product did not meet the expected standards of quality and reliability, and the service fell short of providing the necessary support."
First of all this is really good product if source of water is bore well or TDS is high in the area .At my place TDS is already low so ideally UV is enough and TDS controller is not there in this filter.
"First of all this water purifier is good looking and the Active Copper water tastes really good. The flow of water is also good. Overall it’s an amazing water purifier.Only one thing that could have been better is the design of the tap because every time someone takes water from it, there is some little amount of water wastage.My rating 9.5/10"
"First of all, i’m posting this review only after two days o Installing the product.In my case, the product installation was done after four days of receiving the product. I expected a better installation service. In my area, the water is very hard. But this purifier works like a charm. Taste of Water is also very good. No complaints of now, but I will edit this review if the service provided was not good."
"First, design is unique and very attractive. Second, clearly visible functioning indicators. Third, water quality is also great, despite 1700 tds raw water."
Firstly choose your area where aquaguard service is available and then purchase eureka products. Ro is top in this price range. Water quality is also good and taste is well maintainedAnd you have to pay for pf kit at time of installation.
"Firstly, they charge 700-750/- rupees for installation which is overprice as compared to market rates of 300-500/-. The installation vendor is some third party who came with less pipe for installation and saying it got used up in last installation. Then the product stops working in 40 days of installation. You call them to claim warranty, they tell you to pay 300/- rupees service charge. The product cost may be low, but service and maintenance is too higher. Chose wisely. Not worth it!!No one expects that the product will stop working so soon and wasting money."
Fitting
Five star very good product
For its taste and quality
For my Apple I phone IOT network connection not successful. UC to review and resolve.
Found overall product performance satisfying.
Found thus product where usefull and the system is very user friendly
Fps is good. The service tech was good.
Friendly technician. Good job. Installation completed
From 1200 TDS and salty taste to between 100-150 was swift and completely made water taste 'normal'. Can't say I have any complaints about the effectiveness of the deviceMoving from UV to RO filter has one big downside. You waste double of what you consume (of course we need to collect this discarded water for other purposes)Also the tap is high and does not have a tube attachment is a downside in design. Placing a bottle to collect water becomes cumbersome
From last 1year i am using this product. For every 2 to 3 months I faced issue like water leakge first time with 300rs service charge.2nd time  adaptor was gone. This time i buy adaptor from service person for 450 rs +service charge 3003rd time again adaptor was gone. This time i have one old adaptor. I managed with that with 300 service charge.4th time auto on/off device was gone. This time 350rs for device and 300 forservice charge.Additionally the service will tell us to clean the Prefilter instead of he cleaning it.  When we reach customer care they told us check with service personNever buy this product. If you buy maintenance will be the half of MRP for every year.
Fully satisfied
"Fully satisfied. Genuineness of Aquaguard and safety of stainless steel tank. Installation was 1 day late but the installation engineer was very professional and polite. He installed it, checked for any leakages, etc and configured TDS according to our taste, preferences and liking.Their AMC is also value for money and fast service.Already have 2 Aquaguard machines 👍🏻👌🏻"

"GOT INSTALLED TODAY, TILL NOW ALL WORKING GOOD. TECHNICIAN WAS EXPERT TOOK LESS TIME AND CLEAN INSTALLATION."
"Got the AO smith Z5 and installed on the 1st of Dec, 2023. It was good but started leaking in 11 days. Had a few issues trying to get in touch with A0 smith India (product service centre) l, tried all the 1800 numbers and no one picked up. Tried sending an Email to Amazon and AO smith and got a response after another day that they have dispatched a technician. It was just a simple float wore issue that wasn't trimmed enough and IT WAS FIXED AND WIRKING WELL NOW. The purifier does look good and works well just a little stressful to get a response on the phone. So far its a good water purifier."
Got the product delivered in 1 day by Amazon and installation completed next day without any hassles. Good service from Eureka Forbes so far. Keep it up.
"Got this at a decent rate of 6700/- where other purifiers were in excess of 10k. I was specifically looking for a sleek model without storage that fits my kitchen space. After various consideration, this was my choice.The installation was super quick & the guy was super helpful.I've been using this for almost a month now and it's working fine."
"Got this product on sale and it works amazing. The water taste is good and pure. There is no issues at all from 4 months. Also, one request to havells to include prefilter as well. It will help us a lot or else the service people will charge 1000 rs to install and provide one."

"Has done lot of research and was looking for alternate option for RO. Found this Indian brand. Installation will be done free of cost and all the required parts are included in the package it self. It is simple purifier without adding or removing any minerals from water. TDS was 290 before and 160 after purifying. Using it from a week, Taste is simple and good. Main reason for buying this product is Annual Maintenance cost which willl be around 3k."
Hassle free installation And support
Hassle free installation process and installation agent Aman Tiwari had provided all the information about services and product 👌 👍 👏
Hassle free installationTDS adjusted according to requirementSleek design
Hassle free onstallation . Good product
Hassle free usage and very useful for saving space with top quality drinking water.Under the counter feature makes the product very sleek and elegant
"Hassle free, working as a water purifier supposed to work, silent process, water tastes so good, and cherry on the top A.O. Smith service, you will not need frequent services like other brands."
Have a buy an additional filter though.
Have been a regular UC User and am impressed by the look of the machine. The installation professional adjusted the TDS filter and the water taste is also great
Have been using from last 3 months
"Have been using it for 3 months, so far no issues. If you have power issues your place, suggest to go lower variant of it without touch but manual tap type dispenser. As you cannot dispense water if no power with touch based model.With 2 years unconditional warranty, I expect to save at least 50% of its price.Some hassle during installation led to many days delay unless I lost my calm. Else installation person did arrive very next day first time. 1 star less for it."
"Have been using since 5 days.Really happy with the product received Proven RO system.Water tastes good, its alkaline,UV and copper. Looks good too. Installation guy was super nice."
Have been using this filter since 1.5 years. Filters last long. Water quality is great! Bonus..No R.O in this! Which is harmful to the health!
"Have been using this model at both my homes for over 6-8months now. No issues seen, best part is the filter is always flushed before and after every purification that dds to the life of the purifier."
"Have to call service guy for 4 times within a month of installation, one day would leak from here another day after service some other issue, thought livpure is a good brand , but looks worst than the cheapest available option available locally. Sad to experience the loss of quality parts these manufacturers make nowadays."
Havell is a best quality and service is also very good
"Havells delivered the quality yet again with this water purifier. It is compact, beautiful in design, powerful, and highly efficient. I had muddy water in my area but this purifier cleans it so well that amazes me. Not only the product but service is also quick and smooth."
Havells feb alkaline good product
Havells service is good too
"Having a good experience with the Under the Sink AO smith water purifier, it saves the space as well and water quality is up to mark."

Heavy leakage in filterTechnician not responding properly and supervisorWasted money buying in on line
"Hi all,Please don't buy this product. They sell the product mentioning as 4 years free service but they are fooling all of you. I have already called 4 times engineer to fix issues within a year. In addition they are selling additional filter saying it will keep your filter fine. Who buys  filter for a filter?Don't buy kent products. I was using pureit product earlier which didn't give me any pain for years."
"Hi this is honest review about this product . Please do not by this product as no water purified by this RO , water is coming directly and water taste is bad . My normal water tase is good . Informed to Amazon and product customer service but nobody bother about this . I requested  to return /exchange this product on time before 8th march as per the condition but no response provided even after saying yes by Amazon and taking my request.After that I have received product customer service call to know about product, I replied same water tase is not good please pleas check itNo service , no trust , wasting of money, wrong commitment, false information by Amazon and brandPlease do not go with this product"
"High quality product, water is 100% pure"
Highly recommended product
Highly recommended.
"Highly satisfied with the product, suitable for hard water"
Highly satisfied with the product. It has been more than 3 months since I purchased the product. No complaints so far. Service is also very good.
Hindustan liver service is very poor…don’t buy products
Honestly product is awesome..all fealtures in one
Hoping ii would give a good performance.
Horrible product. The warranty is very board but does not cover anything. Does not cover part replacement or filters. Product is made of bad plastic that smells. I had diarrhea after drinking this DO NOT BUY!!!
Horrible!Read this review carefully!Don't go just by looking at price on Amazon.Main game is ahead.1. I schedule maintenance before warranty ends but they doesn't respond but after warranty ends they forcefully shown that order completed but the Maintenance person doesn't visited but he shown that service is completed.When I called customers they said warranty is end and you need to pay charges for visit.2. My daily water usage is 5-6 litters but at the end of year company said you need Rs 6000 to change the filters and you need to do that every year.It's horrible! Don't buy you will definitely disappoint.
Hot and cold water
Hot and cold water filter system are so good
Hot and Cold Water Functionality...Easy to handle...
Hot water is good
Hot water is very useful
Hot water option is the best on this
"Hot, warm and cold is very nice feature, my parents usually drink warm water and its best for them. They love it.During winters it takes 30-45 sec to make the water warm. Same thing microwave can do but its good to avoid microwaves.The water quality is great. Looks and touch functionality is awesome. Premium looking model. Very convenient for warm and hot water. Steel tank for both hot and cold is healthy.It is the best in this segment where you want to enjoy warm and hot water as well.I given only 4 star due to minor cons:1. Its touch - so will not work without electricity  but since i have inverter i can use it on it.2. TDS controller is NOT present, which should be there considering the price range.3. AMC is costly, well it is in case of all purifiers though.I would definitely recommend it, as i compared all the other purifiers with these features and i think its best."
"HUL is having the solution, there is provison for manual tap fitment, but they are selling as spare!! Amazon must analyse such basic functionality related point before putting the product on platform, as customer trust Amazon more than the manufacturer.  Why HUL cant offer manual provsion along with product!!"
"HUL pureit revito prime, After a week of usage:What's good:1. The packaging contains everything that anyone might need. Nothing to be purchased from outside or from the technician.2. Taste of the water is really good. And the best part is no adjustment of adding unfiltered water to the filtered water.3. Water wastage is very low as being marketed.What can be better:1. You need to give about 48 hrs for the company to get the installation done, which is a slower serviceas compared to rival brands.2. Price is a little high as this has been recently launched."
I am continually trying for service for past 3 month there is no response from their side … we invest this much amount and buying a product but there is no response … for what u r selling this product first… don’t buy this waste of money
I am family is very happy water is best quality
"I am giving this review based on my experience with the worst product ever..I am not against the seller..This is purely my experience with the product I purchased..First thing first M2 urban company water purifier is very flimsy..plastic is very cheap.Secondly Custer service delayed installation..rude behavior,laid back attitude..To sum up seller is kind and good ..I will never recommend this product to any one  whatsoever..period…."
I am glad that I chose Proven Zinc Copper RO filter over other brands. The product is exceptional and a steal at this price.
I am happy for this product but i hoping services can be provide me happy
I am happy with live pure
I am happy with the product
"I am happy with the product but not a good review with the installation part. It was an hectic as i got the number for the technician, whenever i call the technician here call was busy only, as soon as it rings then he will not receive the call and immediately the cell will switch off.Product is 💯 awesome"
I am happy with the product. And also installation process very fast.
I am highly satisfied with the product and installation service. Looking forward to seeing such services in future from HUL.
I am like Havells product RO
I am old user..happy..
i am satisfied
I am super happy with this Product and will recommend to e everyone in my friends circleSuper happy to see your customer experience by Ms. Susmita
"I am using around 1 month, the product is very good.... working fine, taste of water is also like expensive RO systems....till date no problem....best part the price is pocket friendly for middle class family"
I am using from last one week and I satisfied with the product
"I am using glo++, due to water leakage from inside it stopped working, same day I have registered the issue and I got confirmation that next day someone will visit, but no one called and it's been more than five days, no one bother about assigning the technician, helpdesk is saying that we have escalated your issue, escalation3 area service manager is not my picking up the call, 2nd escalation also switched off his phone, helpdesk is also not doing anything. So requesting all off you not to buy this otherwise you will face service issue"
I am using it and I think it's worth the money.
"I am using it since a month, don't find any issues with the product it looks awesome in my kitchen"
I am using kinso for more than 6 months now and very much satisfied with the product. One of the best products in very cheap price.
I am using salt water for filtration. The water is good in taste.Installation is bit costly but good Installation.
I am using since 6 months and find no issues in it .Worth buying
"I am using since a month it was very good and water purifier very well, Budget friendly.I recommend to buy liv pure brand..."
"I am using that’s good water purity 👍.But sometimes, I hear different sound."
I am using this product for my home. One disadvantages is storage tank was made up of plastic. Need to fix extra stand at the base of this storage tank.Overall good product and customer care is very supportive from the day of delivery.
I am using this product from last 5 months without any issues...!!!
I am using this product since last 2 year it's working fine and good service at door step.100% worth to buy this product.
I am using this product since last 4 months and the performance of the product is very good and satisfactory.
"I am using this purifier for the last 3 months , am satisfied with the quality, taste of water. It's come with prefilter with housing in the box."
"I am using this since starting February 2024 and I am happy with this RO and Installation guy, He was very polite and done the installation very well and neatly."
I am very happy with my purchase. Go for it.
I am very happy with the product and the installation service provided. Highly recommended to buy this product.
I am very impressed by his skills and knowledge regarding ro purifier. Will recommend this person and good water purifier.
"I am very impressed with the installation service done by Mithilesh Mishra Ji. He explained everything to me regarding how to use the product, about warranty features, etc. Bravo for his commitment to his work."
I am very satisfied about your product
I am writing after using 1.5yr around . Worst product. No service support . Whenever we call for service request we have beg behind them . But after warranty time period they spoke well and made us to take AMC for 4.5k . After that again original faced revealed . I requested for service request . Machine not working asked to come around 15days it is now ( 2/04/24) agent saying no spare parts .so wait .got exhausted .Never purchase these type of items .
I am writing the review after using 3 day.Water taste is good due to alkaline filter. Right now after using this water purifier TDS level of water is 70. Installation is very fast & Technician are well trained & behavior is good.One thing I would say to amazon plz focus on packaging. As we ordered a valuable product. It's should be taken care by courier.Last point:- HIGHLY RECOMMEND MUSY BUY.. If anyone search for a good water purifier just go for it.....
"I am writing this after a month,product is very nice and also it makes water taste very good. Go for it. Design is also very good and purifier body quality is also osm according to this price."
"I am writing this review after using 2 months,1. Taste is very good.2. Water wastage is less.3. Water filling time is less so quickly filling thank full.4. Most economical product with RO UV and UF technologies.5. As of no no leakages found.6. I homemade my own installation with local team as per the local person, we can get all the parts very easily and the affordable prices.In my suggestion instead of expensive branded items please go with this, so that we will get maximum technological benefits under affordable price.If any repair we can get a local technician can repair it."
"I am writing this review after using it for 2.5months. Happy with the product, installation person did neat job. Water is also good and iam happy with it."
I am writing this review after using the product for 2 years. I would say that the body part is of very cheap plastic material. The machine fell from the wall mount suddely due to cheap plastic material and it broke the tap and hinge. So i would not recommend this product.
I baught this  Royal Aquafresh Water Purifier from amazon after multiple returns of other brands. Done the installation on 08-Mar-24. The product is Really Good and matched my requirement within the Budget range. The attitude of the technician also good and finished. Finally I can give 5 out 5 to this product and service  and recommand to all buy this.
"I baught this machine just 6 month back. I was hunting for so many type of purifier, finally found this nano filter variant. It maintains TDS level above 200 which is very good for our health and tasty also. Getting good service support also at Chennai, happy to have this machine."
"I bought 2 of these same RO water purifiers for different houses. Both of them have massive issue after one year, repair guy was asking for around 6K but the new RO is just 8-9K. I do not receommend this at all. Please go for a better one and pay few thousand extra, you'll anyway end up paying for new one."
"I bought it for 9500 rs and I have to pay 3500rs every 10-12 months, that is too much...pls keep this cost in mind before buying it...there is some germ kill kit that you have to change at every 6000 lt and that cost is 3500 rs..."
I bought it for my Baroda apartment some 4 months back  and  is quite good gas not given any troubles far
I BOUGHT KINSO RO ON LAST SEPTEMBER 23.BUT BLACK DUST COMING FROM TAP OF KINSO FILTER .I  TRYING TO CALL SERVICE CENTRE WHOLE DAY NO ONE RECPONDING.THE GUY WHO CAME TO INSTASLL HIS MOBILE IS SWITH O
I bought the product two years back and it works very well. Service is excellent. Got annual maintenance done by Shahal and Ananthu. They were very prompt and professional. Highly recommended.
I bought this 1 week ago. The installation personnel installed it as per my convenience. It took less than 15 minutes to install it. The model looks pretty and works well. I trust aqua guard. It provides good service too. So I went for it.
"I bought this 2 yrs ago and have soent so much money on servicing and repair. If you shift residence and pay them for uninstallation and reinstallation also, the address is not updated in their records. And from there on it is an additional struggle. Despite having it re-installed in the new house, we are surviving on bottled water in this summer heat. Never going to buy this brand of RO again🙏🙏🙏"
I bought this around 15 days ago and it turns out to be the best water purifier i have used. Water quality is great. Look is compact and rich.  Aquaguard service is also best. Purifier was installed just next day. Price is good for the quality. A must buy
"I bought this arround 2yrs back and let me tell you I'm just calling service centres daily no help  provided,filters are really costly and  only works for 3months, the device is nothing but a money sucking device in a year I paid triple the price of the machine for filter and service and my device still not working do not buy the device."
I bought this because of Alkaline technology. Water taste is good. And service is superb and also the technician are friendly also the support team act quickly. Must buy
"I bought this in the month of October 2023 and its installed in November 2023 and we hardly used 15 days and the NF FILTER is not working and i raised a complaint and they dispatched a new one it's been 20 days and I am still waiting for the filter ,i will update further on this ,right now it's kept aside as shown in the above image..I will update further once I receive the filter and deployed backMy filter got replaced by technician and now the ppm level is 180 which is within the limit and peore pro team also explained why the delivery got delayed .Prore pro team is very happy to announce that they are opening a spare/service authorised center in Hyderabad in Feb/March this year which could help us to get the spare product within a day ,so this delhivery issues will be sortedWill be updating the peopre pro progress after two months .."
"I bought this last year. First of all the unit stopped working in a few months. The technician mentioned that this unit will stop working like this without an extra external filter. So ended up installing an external filter (2.5K) and the unit started working. This external filter is not covered in the AMC and need to be replaced every year with extra cost.The worst part is that the unit displayed red light after an year indicating that the filters need to be replaced. I created a SR and they didn't have the replacement filter then. Then after few days the water completely stopped which apparently is a feature where unit stops working after pumping a specified liters water and forces you to change the filter. Not sure how I feel about that. Assuming that is a good thing and not a business thing, they should atleast have replacement filters to do the replacement in time. Now for the last 10 days the unit is not working and they still couldn't arrange for the replacement filter. Absolutely worst service. Their customer care is super useless. On top of it they are promptly calling me to renew the AMC which is extremely frustrating.So please be aware that this model requires an external filter for sure and water will stop suddenly when the 1 year mark happens. That coupled with the super bad service from Aquaguard makes this model completely useless."
I bought this M2 water purifier 15 days before. Great experience in instalation. All details feeded in UC app. Hassle free instalation and usage. We can monitor our water tds level in App. Water taste is good.
"I bought this product 3 months ago and 2 of its parts got damaged in just 3 months also Rs 300 visiting charge is charged separately for repairing it every time, this is a very useless product, don't purchase it."
"I bought this product as per my water test and I required Gravity filter only. But I am very disappointed because of the product functionality.Below are the issues I am facing.1.  Top tank filter in not  fast. We have to pour a cup of around half to 1 litter (not sure exactly). And it will take few minutes to filter. Either we need a continues supply of water or wait for pouring again and again.2. The main issue is this. The below tank filter rate is almost equal as top, but less.  When top tank is empty, air will stuck in bottom filter. Due to which the flow will be like drops. Like a leak in a pipe. To make it fast we have to remove the top tank and inject the water filled in a syringe from bottom to upward in the bottom tank to get ride of air bubbles. Which is an hectic process. After that it will work as normal. I tried my best to not entering air in bottom filter. For that I kept on filling water in the above tank filter, took hours. Here is another issue, when the bottom tank is full, it start overflowing through the gap between two tanks. So, don't think that if bottom is full top will store remaining! Basically I tried all jugads to make it work.I called customer service and they said they can't help with this service and no home service for Gravity filter.So , if someone who face the same issue or solved it please let me know how. Else you can upvote the review for the new buyers."
"I bought this product but no where it is mention to check the TDA as Livpure doesn’t install the product for above 2000 TDS but no one is taking the ownership. As a customer, This is incomplete information and even amazon customer care are also not helping."
I bought this product from Amazon and it’s good and service was on point
"I bought this product from Amazon for my 4 members family. When I first chose this product, I think this a below average product. But when I installed this and start using, I saw this is a very good product in this price. My running water TDS is 972 after filtration TDS becomes 72 only. This water purifier also have coper and TDS modification option."
"I bought this product in Jan and in within two months the tap started dribbling, and the warranty covers only the electric items which we not know offService team came up and charged me his petrol fee and the partI feel its best to get local water purifier around 5-6k as the maintenance of this aquaguard is so high and why to get this for 15k where they wont even repair the tap free under warranty and after 4-6 months of use it will cost us 1k -2k and after 60k litres the maintenance would cost around 5kDont go for it, I took it though seeing low rating revieiws thinking everyone else is not facing any issue using it but I regret buying this."
I bought this product in Jan'24 to replace by old Aquaguard which I used for 10+ years and regretted the decision ever since.Absolutely garbage of a product. Water tank filling is slow af. Takes an hr to fill 20% and this is not even a RO. Tried customer care twice. They visited saying air trap issues and asked me to do some removal and refit pipe thing to resolve issue. Did not work at all. So don't waste money on this and better opt for something that actually works. Very erratic product. Not recommended at all.
"I bought this product in November 2023 and it stop working in February 2024....called multiple times to the service center, it's been 15 days now.....no support till date."
"I bought this RO approximately 2 and half years ago. Since acquiring the RO, we have encountered recurring issues every four months, necessitating costly filter replacements. Given the frequency of these replacements, it is notable that the cumulative expenditure on filters alone could have feasibly covered the cost of acquiring two entirely new RO systems. To date, I estimate having replaced the filters at least 12 times.Based on our experiences, I strongly advise against purchasing this particular RO system. The recurring problems and associated financial burden have rendered the investment less than satisfactory, and I believe exploring alternative options would be prudent for future considerations"
"I bought this water filter in month of dec 23 and got some issue with the carbon candles as it did not filter water fully, i dont know that the issue with the municipal water or something else so i contact rama service centre and tell them the problem i faced they listen and sent me ceramic candle as replacement.If the customer service of the company value their customers that will be truly appreciated.Thanks for listening my problem and providing me a solution.Thanks"
"I bought this water purifier 2 months ago, the Installation team was very helpful and they provide me demo as well, and after using this water purifier for 2 months there is not an issue till the time. I am 100% setisfied customer and wish to recommend this product."
I brought this about a month ago and this is installed by the technician and now this is not working properly and trying to raise a complaint from last 2weeks and no one responded and raised req on app and called customer service multiple times still no response
I brought this product 3 months back and the product is amazing.  I got best purified water in minutes. its cool and hot option is also added advantage for this product.  Over all i am very much satisfied about the product
I call the number displayed in product but number doesn’t exist.
"I called the service number today after 8 Months of buying the product, The service rep ended up asking you to purchase all fillters again spending another 3K since the water taste changed."
"i checked so many ROs in online in the price range, and i ordered this one,really i am very happy with this product, water taste is really awesome, package was good and reached very quick before the delivery date,i liked very much, thanks to amazon,"
I complaint for service but after 48 hours my filter is not serving by the company
"I completely disappointed , please don't buy this product, after purchase in two months it's get stop working, uv light stop working, finally I stop water in take and out , product is in warranty to option to reach product support team, no service available. Now it's completely scrap within two months"
"I did a lot of research before buying this water purifier from a well known brand like Eureka Forbes Aquaguard. As mentioned in the title this model is the most suitable water purifier for Bombayiite's BMC water supply. As per the TDS chart a reading between 50-150 ppm is considered excellent for drinking water. The reading on my Municipal tap water was showing 65 ppm. In addition to filtering all germs, bacteria and small debris this purifier is also equipped with UV e-boiling which would kill all the viruses in water.The unit comes with a 6 Litres built in reservoir which is helpful incase there is no electricity. The storage water capacity of 6 Litres can easily suffice for a day. The LED light indicators show the water purification status as well as time for servicing.I deliberately chose this model over the RO model. Being in mainland Bombay one doesn't require RO water purifier as the TDS levels in water from municipal taps is acceptable. Besides RO blocks essential minerals and also results in wastage of water, sometimes as much as 7 litres per 1 litre of purified water.Coming back to my unit. The installation was done by Aquaguard authorised technician. The extra connector costed me ₹200 extra but that's just how installation works. Being using it for the past 3 months, it is working flawlessly.Thanks to Amazon India I got a fantastic deal on this product. The delivery and packaging was typical Amazon with no complaints, whatsoever."
I didn’t get the manual tap in the boxing
I didn't expect the Kent product kent is fully cheeting the customer.they (kent) saying is zero wastege but no fully wasted water. Water also no taste same as a bore waterThis is not fair.they are cheeting the customer.😡 Don't buy this item
"I didnt like Wastage of water while filling up the tank ,While filling tank it waste almost 3 time more of tank capacity.  And even after taste is also not so good."
I don’t think it’s purify the water and tap water is same taste as purified water also filter lost with in one year and need to bear 5k only to change the filter
I dread RO water because of its peculiar taste but the water from this Aquaguard product is similar to normal mineral water and much better than other RO products. The alkaline diffuser seems to work fine. The package came in good condition and installation was prompt. Overall nice experience so far.
I feel a state of satisfaction after using the proven RO. Service is good so far.
"I found this product is really very good with this price range. These are below points to buy this product.1. Best water purifier with lot features with this price range, even you can compare with 15k-20k branded water purifier.2. Tank fills in 30min.3. Installation happened in the same day when the product delivered and Technician was very polite and installed on time.4. TDS set to 40 after using this water purifier.5. Indicator for Tank fill, power on/off and filter.6.I am giving this review after using 1month of this product and I haven't face any issue."
I given the complainant on 20 days back but no one given me call for service and the team is not able to handle properly service technician also and bad behaviour and they what is the use of taking amc not giving proper service on the product please don't buy please don't waste money and don't waste time now i am becoming fool by this people of ureka forbes
I got a defective product.It's PCB had to be changed on day 1 itself.Customer care was very poor & novice.Faced problem like this at Amazon for the first time.
"I got a open box, and the product is old and after informing amazon they agreed to initiate return. The pickup did not happen or I got any calls after 2-3 times rescheduling they said, some investigation was done and now it wont be refunded. I am left with no support and one very expensive pre-used condition aquagard and no help from amazon."
I got defective item. It is really very pathetic item because it is working properly. I would like to suggest. Plz don't buy this product. Please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
"I got delivered this purifier. The machine looks good and sleek.But the person who came for the installation process, is not fully equipped and knowledgeable. He couldn't able to make a simple hole for the tap because he didn't have the proper equipment to do that. I had to ask other person to do it. I was not asked to prepare the hole for tap installation previously by customer care."
I got it installed a week ago and it already has stopped working. Do not buy this product.
I got surprised when I saw Livpure offering 30 months of free maintenance. That was the primary reason why I bought this water purifier. My earlier one was creating a lot of hassles. I was shelling out 4K-5k every year towards maintenance.Looks good too. Hopefully now my maintenance worries will be taken care by Livpure that too with no additional costs for 30 months.
I got this purifier in a deal and it has been a great purchase. The after sales was good and gave all relevant infor and made sure everything was working before leaving. The purifier is compact and wastes way less water than my previous purifier.
"I grateful to share the feedback here again after use of three week. It gives good taste since last two week of use, value for money, who is looking for water purifier with budget friendly go for it without having doubts."
I had booked the water purifier but I only got one booked we’re all the other parts missing since day one I am teaching you people and complaint about this but till date no respond it been 45 days  This not the right way that you people treat us  I am so so anger the way you people treated us .
"I had bought this purifier, no one came to install it for 1 week, finally had to return this product, worst service seen ever, never go for HUL product."
"I had purchased this product in Winters of 2021. As far as water filtration is concerned, this has done the job without much issues. There are two filter replacement indicators, the GKK1 and the GKK2 filter replacement indicators respectively. The first filter replacement indicator came on approximately 10-12 months after installation. It was done promptly and the water filtration continued to work fine without issues after that. Around 8-ish months after GKK1 replacement, the GKK2 filter replacement light came on. The replacement was again done promptly by the authorized technician. However, around a month later water started leaking. I called for a technician who came within the stipulated timelines and found that one end of the pipe connecting the output to the outlet had come loose. The technician fixed re-seated the pipe and tightened a zip-tie around it. Leakage stopped. A week later leakage again started. This time I opened up the filter and found that the same pipe had come off again. I placed it back on, and replaced the zip tie with one of my own and tightened it as much as I could. A few days later, to my utter disappointment, leakage restarted. This time I called Pureit and asked them to send an engineer over. He found that this time the RO pump had burst 😱, and had to be replaced. He told me the part would need to be ordered and would be replaced in about 2-4 days. I okayed the replacement and the technician went away. It took about a month, about 4-5 follow-ups, and an escalation request to the service centre magaer, for the part to arrive. The pump was replaced at a cost of 2500.After replacement things were all good for about 2 months (warrantly on replacement parts / repair is 1 month), after which the leakage started again. I promptly asked for a technician visit which was arranged the next day. The unit was opened and the same outlet pipe had come off, again.It was put back on, this time with a new zip-tie. I will keep updating this review whenever this problem recurs, if it recurs.The product is good, and other people may never face this issue. However, I personally feel that the way that pipe has been attached to the coupler (from which it comes off undone every-time) is a design flaw.I would advise that if you can then go for some other model.As far as water quality and other things are concerned, I have not faced any issues so far.I'm sorry I do not remember the cost of the GKK1 and GKK2 filters but it is as running cost associated with any RO purifier and this also depends on the level of impurities and the amount of usage.The TDS of my water supply is around 800-1100 and this filter brings it down to around 75-80 (as measured by those Chinese TDS metres readily found on amazon)."
"I had replacement of my filter 7 days back and it had a issue within 7 days, the service guy tells me dont raise frequent requests otherwise you will be charged"
I have  been using havells aquas water purifier from the last 2-3 months. What a nice & wonderful  product  from havells. This has been well fitted between the corners of two walls which makes this product outstanding  among others. Water purification  is up to the mark. Service staff are well behaved and professional. -------ARUN MANI TRIPATHI
"I have a UV filter without storage and usually we stored water in a matka. But it was not feasible anymore due to lack of space, so bought this wall mount 30L tank.This has solved 2 of my problems.1. Space2. Auto cut-offThe tank comes with a water level switch, which can easily be wired to the filter so that it switches off quickly once the level is topped up. Very helpful indeed. Installation was a breeze and everything was provided with the package, including mounting frame, screws, level switch, tap, etc.Quality is also good."
I have Avery bad experience with AO services. After call logging they promised to attend the call within 24Hrs but call was not attended 7-8 days and you need to called then multiple times and escalated at top level. After escalation at top level as well it will take 3 days to attend the call. Pathetic and suggested not to buy AO smith product more 😡😡😡
"I have been raise service requests evrry day for the water leakage. 1st time they attended, whicb ended up increasing the leakage, and after that they just cancel the request every time. So shocking that there is no way handle such holes in their system"
"I have been this RO from last 5 months -and it has  the Best water quality,best features with best design..."
"I have been using AO Smith products for more than 9 years and this was my first purchase of their water purifier.It turned out to be another great product from AO Smith.The company has excellent customer care service which I have experienced in the past and even during the installation of this purifier.The build quality is really good and the design is also very modern.The only thing to remember whilst buying this particular unit Z9 is that in order to get water from the purifier, your unit must have electricity. This unit dispenses water using a push button. The buttons operate only if there is electricity. If your area has electricity issues, then you should go for the Z8 model which has a water dispensing switch which basically is like a water tap. So even when there is no power, you can get water from the purifier."
"I have been using AO Smith products for the last 9 years. The product has been flawless for the last 9 years, I decided to buy this for the new home. Wonderful customer support team as well. Highly recommend the brand."
I have been using since past one month no issues so far. Nice product with a reasonable price and quality in taste. Highly recommended. Installation service is also good.
"I have been using the product for more than a month now and it seems to be absolutely amazing, The best part about it is the price under 5k you won't find such amazing product"
"I have been using this filter for the last 2 weeks, it is working without any issues. the water quality is good,  Need to watch its performance from long term perspective."
I have been using this for last 4 months. From the time I bought it has a light foul taste and flavour till today. Initially I thought because its new machine and will change after few refill. I have another Aquaguard purifier which uses the same source of water and the result is clean drinking water. So wondering if this machine is new or had been in use and resold as the water tase is like from an old tank. I may be wrong !
I have been using this for past 2 months. Working great. No complaints. Water is good and great work from installation people.
"I have been using this product since 2016, it just requires one service per year for replacement of filters else no maintenance is required, my last product runs for 8 years hence purchased same again.."
I have been using this purifier for more than 1 month and I am really surprised by the water quality and taste it offers in this price range... Best in the market... Really satisfied with this product...
"I have bought AURA RO at the month of July 23 after 8 month water flow stop automatically so I have raised complaint for the same by Eureka Forbes mobile app & given complaint number & claim that technician will connect within 24 hours but after 3 days i follow up that technician whose number in app & he said your location is not under my zone & said, will given other technician no & cut the call but till time i have not received any technician number. so i have mail to company's email address regarding this issue but there were same replay that technician will connect but after 1 week of complain no any technician visited our home & repairAlso called to customer care but every time , they raised complaint but people by company not given customer service as per company's nameI genuinely  disappoint with service & I don't accepted  this kind of service  by stander company so I have never recommend to any people to buy this company product."
I have bought livepure water purifier from amazon.before that i have visited local market also where if i pay 20k i may have a good purifier. So after searching a lot i have select this model which having all specification with affordable price approx 12k with extended 1 year warrenty.customer care respond was good during installation.my item have been intall within 24hr after delivery. Overall is very good till now water taste is good.After using 10 days overall experiance is very good. I recomend to definately go with this purifier.
"I have bought this 2 years back and till 2 years I have spent 20 K  for only filters and some repairs spent 8 K.Service cost is very high, you cant even expectPlease think again when you want to buy this."
I have bought this product in july month. From last 6 months not even a single servicing done from kent service engineer. Product is good maybe that is the reason they are not interested in servicing.
I have brought this product and it was in the free service period. Instead of several complain and phone calls no one is responding. I have no idea what to do now.So don't buy any product of Kent because if it shows any problem you have no option without throwing it in dustbin.
I have chosen Pro 80 as TDS is high in my apartment and it is working perfectly fine. Water is filtered and good for drinking.. Taste of water is good as well.
I have got worst product I complained for that but no one is answeringVery unsatisfied with response from Aquaguard team
"I have had 3 service visits in 3 months of using the product. It works fine for a month and then breaks down again. Every time they say that I have to pay for the spare parts, absolutely useless. Might asWe’ll go for a new brand instead of these multinationals who are taking customers for a ride."
I have like this product at reasonable cost
I have ordered and very happy with service and quality of the product.  Must buy for your family for quality water drinking for better health.
I have ordered this product on 14nov 2023 and now it's been almost 4 month and my filter was not working so called the service person .They said filter need to change and some other issues within 4 months they have charged almost 1k saying fuge need to replace filter need to replace.Though the product has warrenty.🤬Waste of buying this product as within4 month it stop working and service person charged it also very high .They are using used product or low quality not sure but there is no guarantee that it will work fine after paying this almost 1k to service person.Very worst product😡Never recommend this product to anyone
I have ordered this RO for the second time in my family. I found it really good and in budget.
"I have placed this product in amazon and received the order properly without any damage. After using 4 months it got problem, service member came and repaired the product. In next 3 months again it got problem. Same service person came and fixed, now again problem came, but each time if we raise complaint it is taking 2 days of time to attend the complaint. In 9 months i faced three times issue. they providing warranty for one year alone. Don’t prefer this product."
"I have purchased 2 Water purifier of this model in 2 months gap. But after a fix time interval, both showing same problems. Same parts are getting damaged. Waranty service is very good. But after warranty period end, i think i will get so much problems and expenses. So don't buy it. Worst product"
I have purchased 24litres with 2 Carbon candles 2 weeks back company claims 12 litres filtration in 45 min and since day one  in reality it is taking 10-12 hours for 12 litres of pure water I have tried all cleaning and priming process asked by company to do but as of now filtration is onlyLess than 1litre per hour which is very slow as claimed by company though I experienced issues with the product but satisfied with  very prompt and speedy customer support they have immediately sent pair of new candles as replacement let’s see how the performance
"I have purchased a Livpure RO from Amazon. It's a good product. Our water's TDS was 474 before Livpure installation. After installation, the TDS has reduced, and the current TDS is only 95."
"I have purchased a new water purifier, after installation there was a water leakage,I have raised a complaint, but no technician visitied till nowVery poor customer service,"
"I have purchased Kent RO one year ago. Now company called me for service which is free for 5 years. After the visit of service person, they advised us to change TDS filter for Rs.3200/-. We have changed it. But after service person visit, filter do not run automatically and we have to restart it every time. We have already lodged complaints many times. Service person visits us and meantime machine works after that problem again starts."
"I have purchased on 23 August 2023 . Now not working, raised complaint and service men told filter got damaged and need to replace cost is 2400 rupees… not even six months works ( warranty not included for this complaint)"
"I have purchased this filter November 2023,Now this filter is stop filtering the water. Totally I’m not happy with purchase, I request you too all purchaser who are going or want to purchase this filter please do not purchase, after 2 to 3 filters totally stop the working."
"I have purchased this product 1year before, not sure whose fault either the technician who installed or product fault. Due to weight ,it falldown & cracked, hole on backside."
"I have purchased this product 6 months ago. Now it's second time the RO is not working, and it's been more than 10 days, haven't got any solutions."
I have purchased this product and installed in my home. It's very good product and water taste is nice. 15 litres capacity is sufficient for my 4 members family.
I have purchased this purifier and from the day 1 the water taste is bad its just same as straight out of tap water. Called for customer service multiple time but it didnt solve it. And another big issue is the dispensing tap. It broke 3times in a year. Had to wait for more than 1.5months to get the replacement after multiple calls. Also the design of the tap is not good it make splashes. i strongly not recommending this product.
"I have purchased this purifier in last year June 2023, but presently it's filter cartridge is not working properly,TDS is coming more than 135, have contacted the customer care for replacement of cartridge but they denied and asking for cartridge charge Rs 3000 however it is under waranty period"

"I like your android app.I don't like your timings towards services, as per your time slot 10am to 11am, wait for re-installation, after 11am slot timing changed to 2.30pm but after 4.30pm no one come for re-installation."
I liked
I liked it
I liked it design and it is user friendly. Liked the features.
"I liked it so much I ordered a second one, this time to install in my office. I ordered the filter, it came on schedule and without having to do anything, the installer called the next day and came right away to put it in. He had all his own tools and worked quickly to put it in, and it's been working great ever since. Thevonly disadvantage is you can't put a bottle right up next to the nozzle due to the shape of the machine--the bottle has to be held lower, causing some splatter."
I liked the colour and appearanceTaste is just ok
I liked the installation assistant provided by eureka team. Got installation assistant after 30 minutes of delivery instructions.
I liked the product . Disliked a charges considered for installation. Overall worth it
I liked the product amazing.
I liked the service and as scheduled installation has been done.
I liked the this product so much bcoz i m searching from long time a all rounder and best water purifier for my home which have all the features..lastly i found the purifier which has all the features as well as 10 stage purification wihich other purifier does not have in this price range
I liked this product
I liked this product very much. Have been using it for more than 3 months now. No complaints so far. Cool features to take the convenience aspect to the next level. A lot better than my old eureka forbes RO. Highly recommend to everyone !!
I liked this product.. The water is tasty. Overall Livpure is good. People who are thinking about RO can go with Livpure.
I loke this RO
I love that there is no wastage of water because of RO. But the absence of RO doesn’t affect the purifying power of the aquaguard. The 7l storage is extremely convenient as you can clearly see how much is left. The two modes to turn on the waterflow are very beneficial for filling bottles vs filling a cup. 10/10 wouls recommend
I loved it
"I loved the Product , prompt service and helpful staff"
"I loved the product and will suggest to my family and friends. Rather then spending money on branded companies I suggest you can go by Proven RO, it makes the water purified rather than more then an Branded RO system does not give. Now I'm a Proven family and try to suggest to more family to become members of Proven RO. Thank you and make more families happy."
I loved the service installation. The color combo of the filter is too good which was my favourite.My family  is loving the water quality and infact my parents who are too particular with the odour and taste of drinking water.. they have also accepted this as a better option than the 20 ltr bisleri water bottles
I must recommend this Livepure water purifier to all.. It’s really awesome product including support services!
"I must say Livpure has stepped up its game with Livpure Allura. I was sick of spending a few thousand rupees every 5-6 months on the maintenance of my leading brand water purifier which I purchased just about 2 years back. But to be fair to the brand that I am using, high maintenance costs are a given with all water purifier brands in the market right now - this is where Allura changes the game. I came across Allura while searching for a new water purifier. While I purchased Livpure Allura because I didn't want to continue spending thousands on maintenance, but I just love the neat aesthetics blended in black and copper - my family loves this combination that compliments the bread toaster, cooktop and chimney in our kitchen space! A must buy for people looking to buy a new water purifier with no maintenance hassles for 30 months!"
I order this product received good condition and nice product quality and service was very nice 👍
"I ordered the product for my home and i got installed on time , the service and product quality is commendable . Full paisa wasool"
"I ordered this item rental basis, from 28 Feb 2024 onwards purifier not working. I raised inquiry, got very late response from them. But not single person not visited for service. After awaiting 15 days I raised again for cancellation. And I did recharge but it not working. I didn't used water.  I am suffering from last 40 days. I got call from this livepure company, I requested them to for return RO. But they are asking penalty amount to pay 500 Rupees for not usege charges. Still I couldn't not understand how can they behave like this. Very very bad service.."
"I ordered this product after a long time comparison . The built in quality of the container is superb. I went for the stainless steel product to avoid plastic . Hence, I ordered the steel tap along the product . It’s better to supply steel tap by default without the plastic tap. The assembly of the product is so simple. Even I didn’t look the installation instructions, just by seeing , I can understand and fit properly. The package for each item is so near . All are packed properly. I appreciate the company for these kinds of nice package. Yet, I need to check the durability of the product and container. I will update after six months ."
I ordered this product for my residence . Their service is so good as they arrange technician within a day . 10 out of 10 . Fully satisfied
I ordered this product. Installation was delayed. Product says it is good for all kind of water but the installation tech said it is not good for our need as our TDS is less than 100 and the product does not have feature to control TDS. I initiated a return.
I ordered this purifier as water quality in my area is quite poor. After installation water quality has been improved. Also it works amazing. Only in 30 min water tank become full. Only one thing is inappropriate as i cannot check water level easily. Overall it is very good purifier in the budget
I prefer and recomend to say pls do free installation.
"I purchased it on 1st feb2024. After 2 months of using, I can say it works superb. My house borewell water TDS level is 900 around. It purifies and reduce the TDS to 40. Water is also very tasty. I love this product very much. Product is very best at this price level and very less compared to market price level. Thank you Kinsco.😋"
I purchased it on nov 2023.installation process was wonderful.The product was very good with no issues till now.water purification taste is very good.please go and buy this.
I purchased last month this is third time water tast problem
"I purchased product and after 15days it stop working, I requested for technician and they said complete unit is not working and replace.I asked Eureka frobe for replacement on 21st Feb and they raised complaint saying within 24hours they will replace.. till today no one called or came for replacement and i called almost 20 times. Customer care say they will come in 24 hours.Keep lies all the time and i don’t know what to do.Dear Customer, Your sales complaint no. is CM-210224-25517369. Our representative will contact you in next 4 working hours to attend to your request.-EurekaForbesI request everyone please don’t buy their product, if any issue you frustrating and suffer alot and also you will lose money.Amazon is not taking responsibility at all.Very bad experience and helpless with these fraud people"
"I purchased the Havells RO in September 2023 with the expectation of receiving two free services as advertised. However, my recent experience with their service technician left me feeling frustrated and disappointed.When I applied for the RO service, the technician visited my home and conducted a TDS level check, only to conclude that my RO did not require servicing with a TDS level of 150. While I appreciate the thorough inspection, it leaves me questioning the efficacy of the two free service promises.This experience makes me doubt the real value of the service package offered by Havells. It's disheartening to feel like the free services are just a marketing gimmick rather than a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction.I hope Havells takes customer feedback seriously and reevaluates their service policies to ensure that they deliver on their promises effectively. As a customer, I expected better from a reputable brand like Havells."
"I purchased the product in Aug 2023. After the first month, it started requiring regular servicing. We are requesting service from EurekaForbes every 15 days now because the aquaguard stops working very frequently. And on top of that, this time the servicing agent informed us to change the entire interior of the machine which will cost us 5000 INR. Worst product ever!"
"I purchased the V Guard water purifier with high hopes, given its reputed brand status in India. However, my experience was far from satisfactory. Despite multiple requests to both Amazon and V Guard for installation assistance, the purifier remained uninstalled.After persistent efforts to resolve the issue, I ultimately had to return the product. This was an incredibly frustrating experience, and I've never encountered such poor service before.I strongly caution prospective buyers to think twice before purchasing items from this company. The lack of support and inability to fulfill basic customer needs are concerning indicators of their overall reliability."
"I purchased this product 15 days back not faced any issue till now and installation also done on time he explained it properly how to use the product, compared all other purifier in the market this is best under 5000 budget"
I purchased this product 6 months ago and it’s working very good. The water quality is very good considering the high TDS water that we get from borewells and tankers.The filtration process is different from other ROs. Overall a good product.
"I purchased this product around 6 months back, first time service it took 10 days for the technician to visit. The second time now filter stopped processing water as seems its time to change its filters. this time after 5- calls on 3rd day Technician visited my house and just looking at the status told me that its filter kit needed to be replaced, which cost roughly Rs 5000/- (five thousand Rupees). Is this joke, i purchased the new device in 6400/- and after every 6000 Ltr water processing they are asking 5 thousand rupees!! I am going to throw this device. If you are ready to wait technician for multiple days without any ETA to attend your service request. If you are ready to fetch water from somewhere else for some days, as you are waiting for Eureka engineer to attend your request. If you think you are ok with spending more than Rs 5000/- after 6000 ltrs of water processing. then you can go for it."
I purchased this product but after 15 days not visit on my house to install this filter.Very very very Bad Service after selling the product.Dont buy this product.
"I purchased this product on 23rd December,Now on 12th December (from the foundation day till today) its 1 month has been completed.Now it is not working since 24th January.The service provider is demanding a fee from meBecause they mentioned in warranty card (No warranty for online buyer).And these details are not mentioned online."
I purchased this product with extended warranty but company refuses to claim the warranty when it's within extended warranty. I have replaced it's copper charge element 2 times in a year which costs around ₹1800 per times. I had replaced it's GKK1 filter and within 2 months after replacement it is again blinking for replacement. Worst product & service experience. I won't recommend this product for anyone. If you wish to buy this then be mentally prepared to spend around ₹2000 every other month.
"I purchased this purifier from croma , within 6 months itself I had to complain 5 times as filter would falsely show red signal and filter would stop working.Technician would restart the machine and accepted to change the electrical circuit but they don't have the spares.still no solution by them.So think twice before buying.they don't have any AMC plan.Stick with popular brands only."
"I purchased this water filter as it had option to tune TDS; but after installing this filter this is no good than the bubble water that we purchase from outside for 20rs/20ltr bottle. The TDS keep falling to 20 odd levels when set to 60. Also the TDS maintenance is not digital and is not easy one. The service guy has to open the box, loosen some screw which he says is related to TDS. Waste of money and maintenance cost. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL"
I purchased two water purifiers and both are working fine. Happy with the service 🙂
"I PURCHESED IN SEP-23 NOW MAY BE PUMP NOT WORKING, SO NOW THEY TELL ME IF HIS TECHNICIAN COME IN MY PLACE THEN SERVICE CHARGES EXTRA, IF HIS TECHNICIAN EVELUATE THAT PRODUCT IN WARRNTY THEN I (COUSTMER) HAS TO SEND PARTS IN THEIR HEAD OFFICE, IF PARTS WILL BE DAMAGED IN TRANSPORTATION THEN WARRNTY NOT APPLICABLE..... IN SHORT.... ONCE YOU BUY THEIR PRODUCTS THEN AFTER IT IS NOT WORKING THEN BUY ANOTHER...."
I really appreciate havels for their products.
I really like the product. Thanku so much. Works great and value for money.
I really like this product
I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT AS IT IS AN AFFORTABLE PRODUCT WITH SAME CONFIGURATION AS THAT OF OTHERS.
i really like this. super speed and quality is good . with in 40 mins it fills the tank. 15L capacity is also sufficient.
"I received product that has dent on body so I give 0 star to amazon packing and delivery.I'm not returning it as it took so much time to talk with support and explain it, so i'm using the product with dent.Overall water quality is very good.Water flow from tap is very good with pressure.Kent product is very good so I'm giving 5 star to product but 0 star to its seller and delivery person."
"I received this Waterpurifier 6 days before, still no person came for installation... Please check otherwise I have replace or return the product..."
"I recently bought the Kinsco water purifier (Kinsco Genuine Aqua Laser 15 Litre RO + UV + UF + TDS) and have been using it for some time now. I must say, it's been working wonderfully. Previously, we had the Aquaguard Magna, and we ended up paying 12k for AMC. The Kinsco purifier offers much more at a lower price, and I must say their technician visited my flat and installed it on the very next day without any further delay. I'm glad I made the right choice."
"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Livepure Smart RO's installation service. Despite submitting a request for the reinstallation of my RO system few days ago, I have yet to receive any resolution. I've reached out to their customer care department numerous times, only to be met with empty promises and excuses. Each time I inquire about the status of my request, I'm told it will be completed ""tomorrow,"" but tomorrow never seems to arrive. As a paying customer, this level of incompetence and disregard for customer satisfaction is unacceptable. I urge others to think twice before choosing Livepure Smart RO for their water purification needs, as their service leaves much to be desired."
i recently purchased 2 of this. recently it's not working properly one of this.they demand money for candel filter when you have already cover with warranty . worst product and service i ever had.
"I recently purchased a water filter, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed by its outstanding quality. In a market flooded with options, this water filter truly stands out as a remarkable product that delivers on its promises.From the moment I started using it, I noticed a significant improvement in the taste and purity of the water. The filter's advanced technology seems to effectively remove impurities, ensuring that every sip I take is clean and refreshing. The build of the filter exudes durability, and it gives me confidence that this product is built to last.One aspect that particularly impressed me is its ease of use. The installation process was straightforward, and the user-friendly design makes maintenance a breeze. Additionally, the filter's sleek and modern appearance blends seamlessly with my kitchen décor, adding a touch of elegance to the space.Not only does this water filter provide great quality, but it also offers fantastic value for the price. Considering the improved taste of the water and the peace of mind that comes with knowing that my family is consuming clean and safe water, the investment is truly worthwhile.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this water filter to anyone in search of a reliable, high-quality solution for their water purification needs. Its exceptional performance, combined with its user-friendly design and great value, make it a standout product in its category. I am genuinely satisfied with my purchase and am confident that others will be too."
"I recently purchased the AO Smith water under counter, 5 litres of drinkable storage capacity. Water tastes good & pure. The machine makes no sound and installation was done on time. Overall excellent product and equally efficient installation. AMC charges felt more, company need to consider."
I recently purchased this AO Smith Z9 water purifier it was very good and outstanding product ireally like this having very good purifier Hot @ Normal water
I recently purchased this water purifier from amazon and i am happy with its performance.Build quality is excellent.Installation process is good and within time.Purifier unit look is good.Water taste best and capacity is more than enoughOverall value for money.I highly recommend this product.
"I recieved the RO machine in time, afterwards I had to call the technician who helped in the installation without any problem.The Machine is working perfectly, not much noise, the taste of water is excellent and there is no foul smell, there is also no leakage, the water storage capicity is perfect for a Bachelor of 2 persons or a small family of 3-5 members."
I recommend this
"I registered a complaint in V guard RO customer care for filter service. Technician Satish came for service and did service excellently. he is very experienced, polite and His work is really appreciated."
I request members not to purchase any costly products from Amazon. Now this product occupied a waste corner at m place. They simply say sorry you can't return or replace the product.
I review after using 15 day very good quality product at this price. Me and my family loving it.
I strongly suggest to to buy this purifier if you are looking in budget
"I switched from Kent to Pureit after using kent for 5 years.Pureit Revito prime looks modern and based on the claims stated by Pureit on its website about best in class filtration technology I was inclined to use it.Ever since this purchase I regret it.There is no dedicated Pureit App to trace our requests.I had to follow up for installation and demo on their toll free number.Even when the main switch is turned off, there is water leakage from the external pipe of this product.No resolution after multiple follow-ups.Kent is much better both in terms of products and service as there's absolutely no follow up required from customers end."
"I think kinsco is also very good water purifier brandActually it is very good water purifier within the given budget, this water purifier having the same features as that of branded water purifiers like kent and aquaguard. I am reviewing it after 2 months of use.Even you can't buy a water purifier from roadside shops at this price. Service person install it quickly and taken extra 700 for installation."
I took this water filter 8 months back. It was installed very promptly . The team informed me to service it every 6 months. No service contract was there. Now last 15 days I am following up with different people to come and service the product and still it remains not done. Really regret buying this product and recommend not to buy as you will have a tough time during servicing
"I use it sonce 2 month, no problem with purifier.. installation person was gud .. overall gud product in this price."
"I used from 9th Jan 2023 , frequently water stop , stop value not work, even all 3 cylinder changed but within  2days from repair again machine not functioning....I purchased offline 12000/- & monthly maintenance 250/- . Service center not solved problem permanently 😞"
I used it for a month now its working pretty fine
I want to return
"I wanted to avoid plastic, so purchased rama water filter which is a very old and reputed brand.  Quality of the steel is very good and Heavy.For river or rain water, this is the best filter. Water taste is also very good. Installation is also simple."
"I was a little skeptical in ordering this purifier. But after seeing the ratings and the reviews, I thought of giving it a try. OMG! This purifier from KINSCO is by far the best in it's segment. I mean who can include Copper filter in this price range. What big players in the market are unable to provide, KINSCO is able to deliver more than that and with such affordable costing. The delivery was fast and thanks to Amazon for delivering the package very securely. The service team of KINSCO was prompt to respond to my request and sent the installation guy in the following day of the request. Installation guy was polite and very knowledgeable regarding the water purifier."
I was disappointed as it took 4days to install.
I was gifted this product and got it installed the ro membrane started to leak. Called customer care and they sent technician ( in Chennai) who just stopped the leak but charged me Rs. 500/- for product fault.They did not bother to adjust the TDS level they themselves are saying why you bought this cheap product.Pls don't consider the cheap rate buy a good product
I was hesitant to buyt this as I hadn't heard about the RO company and it was at very less prices but because of amazing reviews bought it.It's much better than my old Livpure Ro that was twice its price.
I was looking for a corner fitted purifier and it fitted perfectly. The only thing is pressure valve is not included and the installler took 900 rs extra for it. So order on advance.
"I was looking for a water purifier under the budget of 5000/-. I was surprised to know that this water purifier includes all the required filters in this range. Now, almost 2 months completed. It is working fine. It provides TDS in the range of 60-70. However, the TDS controller is not that great, but it is manageable."
"I was purchased one month back,This product is good and recommend to buy,Product quality and support was good."
I was researching about NF water purifiers ....I found out that Peore is a startup by IIT alluminiI called them and asked about their products... customer response was great and I bought the purifier...to my surprise they have arranged for installation on the same day and installation is free. I felt awesome about their prompt responseInput TDS is 480-500Output TDS is 170-200 water taste is great
I was skeptical before ordering this product. But after using it all of my doubts got cleared. The water tds level is also low. Good value for money product.
"I was using a RO worth 15000/- changed its filters several time but problem of bad taste and smell didn’t resolve. Then I heard about this product. After replacing my RO system it is resolved now, there is no bad smell and having taste like bottled water.  Best quality product in this price."
"I went for this purifier due to the stainless steel tank as I didn't like that water is stored in plastic. The sediment collecting bottel doesn't come with the package, one needs to buy it for 999/- but I got a coupon discount of 1,000/- so it was covered in that. It's been few months and it's working fine. I collect the water from the outlet in the gallon and use it for plants and cleaning. The service of Havells is good but as this is a new model I couldn't buy the AMC for the next year at the time of installation however one year service is free. Hopefully by that time they'll add it in their product list."
I will recommend
"I would have given less then 1* but don't have an option here.After purchasing this just 15days after it started giving problems like stopped getting purified water(only pink light blinking),making so much noise(very irritating sound).When I called service people,they send service engineer but he comes and checks it only he don't have any kind of knowledge about the product,he never got the solution for this.I am calling from last 1.5 months to aquagaurd customer care but they never solved this.I wasted my hard earned money on this.Please please never buy Aquagaurd product on Amazon or any other platform."
I would have given less then 1* but don't have an option here.After purchasing this just 15days after it started giving problems.No UV purification is there so water is not pure. Water tank is looked like made of reusable plastic. Nowhere looked food grade plastic.Technician told using some antiscalant filter which is chemical. When googled found this is chemical which is only used to enhance membrane life and not good for health.
I would like to mention that your coy must mention about the additional filter for which customer has to pay extra money because your installation team adviced customer that filter is necessary and if it is necessary coy should provide it itself.
"I would like to provide my comments on the four aspects that are involved in getting the product ready to use and seeing its performance:1. Delivery of the product : 4 Star - very good - On time, received in good condition in its original Faber box/packageing.2. Product Quality at opening/installation: 2 Star - Poor - The RO membrane housing unit could not be opened and the service person tried very hard and its top part got broken and became unusable. Rest of the parts were ok. Definitely, no one expects such a part of a product from a premium brand and high end product.3. Product installation: 3 Star - OK - He didn't want to get replacement for the defective product and tried  hard to open the RO membrane hosuing, but couldn't and it got broken. Though he went and brought a replacement part for that, it is a local made duplicate and not like a original part. As it is just a housing part, I decided to go ahead with it. The service technician can handle the filter more carefully. Also, I had to ask him for everything like checking with TDS meter, etc while I expected a good technician to demonstrate the features and quality by himself.4. Product Functioning/Quality: 4 Start - Very Good - It has good filteration capabilities - Got around 50-60 TDS output water from the 180-200+ TDS input water. Also, noticed that about 10-15litres of water drains out while filtering 10ltrs of water in the storage tank of the unit."
I would like to thank you for introducing to such quality product. Your service is definitely up to the mark. It is budget friendly and does shows overall improvement in TDS & taste of water.
I would say it's a must have purifier for every home..so easy to use nd installed by A O Smith team nd looks so elegant nd classy.No mess of regular water purifier.Thank You AO Smith for this awesome under counter water purifier 👍
"I’m using since 3 months too much of water wastage, worst buying this product."
I’m writing review after six months used. After sales service is very poor. Technician not come on given date. Filter also not good it’s blocked after 5 months
Iam happy this product
Iam really exited because. The product work very good
Ideally there should be an option for negative rating. The brand is horrible and worst products and the technician are basically doing cross selling instead of focusing on service part. Within 5 days the product is stopped working water leaking and no water coming from ro. Also after complaining since almost a week i am been told to wait for 24 hrs and the technician will call you.
"if everything go properly, you won't have any issue.  But if you face any issue no one will address them. i got low tds issue. no one came to adgust it. i made lot of requests but costumer care executives never took it seriously."
"If going for Aquagard products, forget about after sales services. Been chasing them for days now with just holding on the customer service line. Very poor service, wish I could give less than 1 star"
If installation is free it’s better to connect the peopleNow I’m paying 600rs
"If the filtration process works as described:RO water gets mixed with water after UF, then what's the point of UF stage?"
If you buy your money will gone
"If you know the service person well, than buy this product. Product is good, but they dont respond fast to service request.For this product - UV Ray is not working/burning out regularly.But this is really worth product compare to other branded products."
If you looking for water purifier at low or budget price you can go with this . Don't go with high brands because they now don't care about costomer because of fame. Go with kinso water purifier customer support was very supportive.And water taste is also good after purifier.
If you want west your money then buy this product. Last year  I had purchased this product and I have paid more amount than it's price for its repairing. With in a year each and every part of this got changed. And it's owner is it's customers care and he is so irresponsible and rude.
"If you're on a budget and prioritize clean, filtered water, the Aqua D Pure is a solid choice. Its affordability and multi-stage filtration are impressive.Some of the things I liked:Affordable: This purifier sits comfortably in the budget-friendlyQuick installation: The company handled the setup efficiently.Performance: Works great so far, delivering clean and crisp water."
I'll suggest to everyone to buy native m1 copper.taste good.love this product
I'm full satisfied
I'm not satisfied as the replacement of filter costs 5k every year. If you don't replace the machine won't work after 13 months from the date of purchase...pure looting...there is no mention about the filter price when u buy product. I came to know only after a year.
"I'm satisfied with the product, it's worth the price"
I'm using since last 1 month. Product is good. Water taste also good. Easy to use and Urban Company installation service also very nice. I am satisfied till now. Lets see it's really give 2 years free service yes or no..
Im using this AO Smith water purifier. It's really good to work and we satisfied much.
"I'm using this product it good product i surely recomend this to all Installation completed within 3 hours it's greate service,I happy to using this RO still now"
"I'm very disappointed with this product,1) installation not done properly but they changed 500rs, top panel is not fixed properly.2) the product output is as low as 11 TDS since the product I purchased is mineralized with zinc and copper. No essential minerals retain.3) plastic quality also not good, we have to by stand separately. If you hang it, it will break in sometime.Not recommend if you are looking for mineralized ro.Recommend if you are looking for non mineralized ro."
Immediate assistance in installation and good product
Immediately after delivery. Product is installed properly and working fine. I would recommend the product.
"Immensely liked the Product.The company really proven that not all good things are over economical rate.Also like the polite and responsible, timely behavior of the installation man...5 out of 5 from me.."
In a short span of ordering this product the water purifier underwent repair twice for water leakage .While this was sorted now the machine has gone faulty with loud motar noise and has stopped working altogether
In a short span of time i have been facing product quality issues and worst part is the after sales service. First Product installation itself took 1 week and in short span of time my aquaguard stopped working it took a week to fix and then within a month that same problem reoccured and it has been 10 days till today with issues still unresolved
In four months we have changed filter for 3 times  And now they said some filter gone in  and we can’t claim warranty if you ask me buy some other product.
In just 1 year i have spend too much money to change all part.
In picture shown only purifier but gave extra out filters which is not at all feasible.filter height is increased and not able to fill water
In short don't buy. There are leakages and the company wouldn't service it in the warranty.
In the first 2-3 days it was giving some bad test and slowly it went. now it is working perfectly.
In the kitchen tap was missing.
In This price it is best
IN THIS PRICE RANGE IT IS A VERY GOOD PURIFIER. I AM PRETTY MUCH IMPRESSIVE WITH THIS UV+UF PURIFIER. AND THE SERVICE IS VERY GOOD. EVEN THE TECHNICIANS BEHAVIOUR IS VERY GOOD.
In this product no any copper or zinc any think its giving pure water 12 litter for taking 3 hours time its worst product i strongly advice you don't purchase
In time installed very good service and product…
"In very short , it stopped working"
India most popular product Havells
"Initial impression is good, Affordable, installation was good. More stage of purification for this price Range."
"Initial installation and service(after 7months) are fine. But had to change the filter in 8th month because of slow water output, the guy who came for free service after 7 months said all filters are fine, but within one month main filter is gone and had to change it(cost 1400), after one week again purifier not working, this time power indicator is blinking. Service person didn't bother to come but on phone video call he diagnosed it as pcb problem and and they as third party agent cannot do it and liv pure company is not responding...it's been 3weeks since then there is nothing has been done...waste of time and money.Service from liv pure is very bad...don't go with this model and if possible ignore livpure brand."
Initial skeptical feel just vanished after using for a week. It works just like how we expect. Even better service to help this keep going. Took the AMC for peace of mind for three years. Good going so far.
"Initially it has 9 PH level now it is reduced to 4 PH level. If I complaint they are transferring it to local service center and they are charging Rs.500 to check. Don't buy this, they are giving falls commitment"
Input water TDs is stable but output water TDs is automatically changing. Service man came to install purifier has not sufficient knowledge and equipment.
Instalation went smoothly and product is nice
Install easy. Even a lay man without any knowledge of RO unit can Install.
Installation
Installation & Engineer Mr.Ravi is good
"Installation and all was fine , in 2-3 months started working very slow it used to take 20 min to filter water now it takes 4 hrs and almost stopped working. Tried to reach out to service team , installed app to raise complain but no response at all. Rescheduled several times and escalated several times but no action. U cant connect to customer support as its dead. So No service at all. Please dont go for eureka forbe or any aqua guard products."

Installation:The whole process was very smooth. The technician arrived on time and were well trained. And the process and results was verified by an urban company person over a video call.One good thing is that they adjust the TDS according to our liking during the installation.8l of tank capacity is very good. The filtration is reasonably fast and taste is good.
Installed and working good!Water taste is good 👍Let's see how it works for long time.
Installed at my workplace with less water needed. The look of the product is amazing and the taste of water is very good due to copper tank.Installation charges of 700 are double the market rate which was surprising to me.
Installed promptly on time and it's working very well
Installed quickly without a delay

Instant installing
"Instead of buying water cans from out side, it's better to buy this purifies, RO,UV,UF,ALK & TDS technology is awesome. Multiple stages of purification gives soft water."

It appears to be useful for a middle class family
It appears to be useful for a middle class family Works perfect Very good product I like Excellent product and service Awesome thanks ..
"It arrived with a defective pre-filter and ceased functioning within 50 days, despite having a 2-year warranty. Unfortunately, the manufacturer has not been responsive in providing the necessary service, leading to a frustrating after-sale experience"
It does the work but costly
It does what it says.10/10 performance. Such an amazing RO with minimum wastage. And it tastes amazing better than Pureit and other brands.After drinking it's water u won't feel like drinking outside water.Very happy with the product.Even I got a call from their company afterwards for its feedback and to address any queries upfront.Highly recommended.Full Paisa vasool
It doesn't work and very bad and useless product not worthy of buying. Worst experience buying this product . Not recommended I would rate this 0 ig there was an option
It fits under the sink unlike the traditional purifier. Overall very good experience with the purifier.
It gets all the filtrations necessary for an RO along with copper mineraliser. The rate of filtering water is also better than others. Water taste is also pretty good. No odour present.The major advantage is that it wastes much less water compared to other RO filters.UV seems to be inside tank so allow some time for the water to sterilize in the tank before using.
It had problems out of box. The installation person from the company opened the box and tested but it gave a beeping sound withbred light. The guy pushed the screw driver left right and center to see if a jolt can make machine work but to no avail. I had to then call up Amazon that i have paid for a new machine and I should get a new working machine out of box. Waiting for them to come and replace.Edit - they have finally agreed to return as the machine was defective but still the refund would take 13-15 days - Imagine this is when one has paid in advance for a product which is defective and the return cycle takes more than a month - while this shows Kent has  poor quality checks and isn't bothered about the customer where they haven't called a single time but more surpsing is pathetic and unexpected behavior from Amazon.
"It has a stainless steel tank, which is excellent for purifying water."
It has been 3 months. No issue till now.
"It has been almost two weeks that I bought this wonderful RO. It has been working well ever since I bought it. The after service was good, the installation agent came on time and explained how the product works. No additional charges were asked."
It has been more than a week and i faced no problem with this RO machine. The water is good.
It has many level of water purification capabilities
It has power indicator and water level indicator
It has stopped working in one month. Can I get some help in this warranty period
It has the copper purifier technology which makes it a healthy option  and great value for money
It is 6 liter best for small family
It is a compact under counter water purifier which does the job well. We have been using it for a month now the storage capacity is good as we are a family of 4. Taste of the water is not sweet as may be our inlet water is having high tds.
It is a good product using it for a week.
"It is a good quality water purifier, installation was fast and smooth, water taste good."
It is a great product and there services is helpful
It is a great product. I am satisfied with it. Highly recommended.
It is a very good item...thanks ...Amazon..
It is a very good water purifier. No trouble is found till today.
It is always a cost to maintain the RO. But this new Allura model came with 30 months warranty and is a great deal.Product looks good aesthetic wise and water also tastes nice. Installation was very quick. Service person came within a day of receiving the product. Explained about Allura in a simple laymen way and work was also neat.Hope they give same support throughout the lifetime of the product.So far very happy with the model.
"It is an amazing product, from quality to service to installation and I highly recommend to buy this product."
"It is an excellent product, particularly if you are using river water. This cleans the water in short span of time and stores it well. By purchasing it, not only I have got clean water to drink, but also saving money on mineral water."
"it is fine, installation services also good."
It is good but this one basic model...better buy high-end model...
"It is good for small family, and budget friendly"
It is good in working and looking nice.  A good item at affordable price and expect the worjing for many years like now. Thanks
It is good product in this price and best water purifier
It is good product...
It is good water purifier for 100 TDS. You can it for municipal water.
"It is good. After deilvering the product, installation has been completed on 3rd day from the delivery."
It is goodVery nice product 👍
"It is just a normal RO, don't gives alkaline water. Alkaline cartage has to be changed within one month otherwise PH of water drops to 6 within one month. It's a fraud in the name of Alkaline water."
It is not able to filter water dust from water. Service is also poor
It is not really good. I bought it ₹5100/-.Tap is not working properly.
It is of very good quality. Using since last three months and have no issues.
It is one of the best purifier. It consuming low power and it store the without any dust in many days easily handle.... It's a good one to buy
It is one of the best water candle filter with nice design and efficient water filtration candles.
It is price wise gud product .. value for money
It is really good product but the filter rate is so high but tast while it is really good and you can buy it
It is really worse purchase as it has leakage problem from tab though installation is easy but they usually ask to take services from them. Even I took additional warranty for small electronic appliance worth 500/- but their service centre is restricted to the particular cities and customer care also do not support to the customer.
It is simple to use quality water purifier I have purchase and it is being used for last 6 months without any issue
It is simple to use quality water purifier I have purchase and it is being used for last 6 months without any issue Had a smooth installation and perfect working since then. Consistent experience of a well designed and produced water purifier. It is very good product satisfied with the overall performance of the product
It is very difficult to write the review of the product within four hours after installation.But has to submit by the repeated request from the concerned person from the installation team.Installation was very nice and the behavior of Mr Chakraborty was very good and prompt service given by him within 4hour of my service request call.for installation it is five star.For the product it is provisionally 4star.
It is very good product satisfied with the overall performance of the product
"It is very good product, on time delivery. Service Engineer response was very good, quick support on installation part, positive response."
It is very good quality product and easy to installed and water quality is excellent.
It is very good water purifier. But needed pre filter.
It is very nice instant and good quality product which also looks attractive
"It is well built, easy to install and provides quality drinking water, and is value for money."
"It is working fine till now, no issues faced"
"It is working fine with fast water refilling, large tank for family of around 6 person.It is very good value for money under its price bracket. Water is also sweet in taste.Good support from customer care. Easy and Quick Installation service."
It is working really good and the installation and delivery was on time.
It looks good. This Water purifier reduces the TDS of the water and gives the better taste for the water.Thank you Amazon. Given the delivery very quick and installation is also done fast.
It nice  . It completes the filteration process in 45 min . Hope to have good service in future.
It purifies the water very fast and is very good in my area iron is about 1400 TDS and it purifies it easily and is very healthy for drinking
It really works great for all kind of water source (borewell and tanker)
"It started beeping just 1 month after purchase.The installation guy did not install it correctly and I had to schedule 3 service calls additionally just after 2 months of purchase.Plus there is no tds controller in the ro, so had to install tds controller separately as tds by default is quite low. Tds controller installation costed me rs. 800 extra."
"It stopped working after 6 weeks, and there is no service it has only toll free num and rating.. now I'm going to the local store to repair my filter."
It stopped working within 10 days of purchase as adapter is of very low quality local made. It’s better not to buy this filter as service is very poor.
It very fad product. I have checked ph level.and it's level one like acidic water.dont bye this product
It very nice and easy to use
It was a good experience buying this product. It was delivered on time. Even installation was quite smooth.Looking forward to a long run.Thanks Amazon..
It was a nice product and quality of purification is good. It is recommended for baby safe.
It was a smooth installation by pureit expert!
It was amazing experience. The installation was done nicely and best way. Loved the product. The service person explained well.

"It was good and quality,and service was also good"
it was good experience.
It was good installation.
"It was good, but i received a non-working UV filter but service person exchanged at no cost."
"It was nice selection for kensko ro , so many same product are in market but this ro looks better . Service is granted withing 24 hrs for installation (add charges according to city area).I am good with that."
It was very worst
It was working very NYC thank u for this product suggestable product to everyone with minimum budget
It works only when power is present suddenly power gone it's very difficult to drink water every time have to store water in other pots and it's not main draw back
"It works well as described. The water in my area has a TDS level above 500. It is filtered to bring it below the acceptable limit of 150. I searched for a good water purifier online for many days, watched numerous YouTube videos, and found that Proven water filter has everything other top brands offer, but at a much lower price. I recommend going for it."
"It’s a decent product for the price range with all the necessary features and functionality, just that the build quality is questionable because the tap that came with it tends to leak slowly from time to time through its joints."
It’s a good filter has normal water and hot water facility with several steps of purification. Water has a good taste and seems to be healthy.
It’s a good product for Banquet hall
It’s a good product to go for
It’s a good product to use
It’s a good product with alkaline and hot water feature
It’s a great deal and value for money product
"It’s absolutely a worst product within 3 months of usage it stopped sending the outlet water out. We registered the complaint and the service is even worse than the product. They responded after 4 months and sent some locally technicians. He replaced the valve and left. It didn’t work after an hour and asked around 600 rupees. Later we got to know it costs only 150. Then we complained again later after 20 days another person comes and say that we should change membranes and other filters and svs motor. None of then can be claimed under warranty which will cost us around 5000. Our TDS was 500 not that much high to change membrane within 3 months. They said that since we used machine despite the problem that’s why it damaged the membrane but they don’t provide any solution when we approach the customer service. Had they have said on call not use the machine given my case , we would have turned it off completely earlier. But they took 4 month to respond. We didn’t know what was the problem. And the water also taste like borewell water when it was working fine.Never buy any faber products because the service and product quality are worst. Its all a marketing gimmick. A person from our place lodged  a complaint against the company in consumer court and company was penalised by 1 lakh rupees."
It’s been 2 months of using it .. I liked the product and taste of the water is good.
It’s been two months I’m using this water purifier and water tastes really good . no issues with product whatsoever.  It looks neat as well
"It’s good UV+UF water purifier, can go for it. It’s best out there."
It’s good value for money

Item delivered on Thursday night. V guard installation guy Ruban called on Friday noon and get it installed with 30 mins.. and explained the features exceptionally. Also did few custom changes where filter was installed based on my request. Excellent and thanks a lot.
"Item not functioning as expected.... Water output is too slow and taste of water is not at all good.Water output suddenly stops, there is no storage tank of 2 liters as mentioned."
item to accha hai...
itis looking good but it should be on mode always item capacity is 8 Ltr storage but if it use for a cup bottle it will on again in the sense 8 Ltr capacity where it storage
Its  better than most of available online
It's a 5 star product. Installation was done within a day. Happy with the purchase.
"It's a big square box, does the work alright but has a bad tap design. Pureit you should be ashamed."
It's a bit noisy compared to my previous Livpure RO. However does the job.
Its a fantastic purifier.
It's a good one at the price i got
"It's a good pick from all Havells water purifier 👍, don't buy others.This is the genuine water purifier that provides Hot, Warm and Ambient options of water. Installation service also good 😊."
Its a good product
It's a good product and service is also good
It's a good product at this price...
It's a good product but it makes a lot of noise.
It's a good product in quality basis.
"Its a good product, but please be wary of another 1200 that you have to spend for the pre-filter"
Its a good product.
It's a good product. Working fine. The outside looks are quite elegant and It's performing well.
It's a good RO water purifier.... I feel like the water taste is a bit hard... But overall good
Its a gud product.
It's a month my machine stopped working and I have raised complaint but no one has turned up buying water from outside. Bought the machine because of the name brand but service after sales is worst.
"It's a nice purifier, worth the price."
"It's a really great water purifier, it's easy to manage as well"
It's a very affordable product and also the water TPM gets very less with this. Installation was quickly done.
It's a very costly water purifier machine according to market value.
It's a very good product! Clean and healthy drinking water!
"Its a very good product, Also the technician was very nice and installed on request. I will recommend this peoduct"
"Its a very nice product in such a price band of ₹5,000.Ease of installation. Water taste is good and hassle free performance. Little bit noisy but adjustable"
Its a worth buy and product doing very good
Its almost 2-3 months and filter is working well with controlled TDS of 5. For this budgets its worth buying. Keep it up Team Kinsco. Hope you continue your such support and services in future too.👍🏻
Its amazing and thanks to pureit for this amazing product
It's amazing water purifier
It's amazing...
It's an amazing product. You will get it in affordable cost and the best in quality ...
It's been 3 months now I am using this filter. I am very satisfied with product and quality. Water taste is also good. Definitely suggest for other to consider who looking for the RO water filter in this price range. It's value for money.
It's been 4 days since I got this and asked Kent service for installation but no installation yet. I'm going to return if they won't install it in next 36 hours -_-
"Its been 5-6 months n its leaking from bottom right side. I raised a service request,  its been 2 days now, nobody came for the service. To speak to customer care, the call is chargeable. I thought it its a very nice product but its Useless product."
Its Been a Month and working fine
"It's been a month since I bought this, The work it does is more than worth the price of this product. I recommend this to everyone who want to buy budget water purifier for their home with 2 to 3 persons."
"It's been a month since we are using this,it purifies well..we have hard water in our area so this changes the taste as well and the water is as if we are drinking from a mineral water bottle.However,rated one star less as there is alot of water wastage and if you are used to filling up many bottles at a time with a tube/pipe,there is no provision for the same."
It's been a week while I am using this product and its working fine but it waste most of water while purifying otherwise everything like water taste and quality is good also it looks aesthetically pleasing.
Its been one year and the quality of filter is nit good.We are getting water worms in the water.
"It's been slightly over 3 months since we bought this purifier  & we already feel cheated. Already 3 times complain had to be lodged. Already control panel faulted, though thankfully it got changed as it is within warranty period. Atleast after 4k, 8k litre water filters have to be changed as mentioned in specification but it's condition has got quite poor as per mechanics observation, we have hardly used 2k litres. They have cleaned it twice on 2 occasions. But I advice others not to buy this product. As other water purifiers at lower cost wud be better. I had Kent & aquaguard previously, but this pureit purifiers maintenance cost seems to be much higher. Money is not d only issue, hassle faced by us is d main problem as calling for service every 2/3wks is cumbersome. Moreso it seems a business strategy that filters get destroyed frequently & buyer has to pay for it, it's not warranty covered. And unlike other purifiers, once filter indicator blink solid red, water will stop pouring automatically, so u have no other option but to pay & get new filter. Extremely poor product. Please don't fall into trap."
Its been three months since i am using this product it is working pretty well
"It's budget friendly, good customer service, good taste of water, easy to install. Really a good product. I recomnad pepole can use this with out. Any hesitation. Really a good product. Thanks to the team ."
It's cost worthy. It's very helpful. This filter gives good filtering. Its a good choice. It helps me in this busy life.
It's easy to use & very efficient product in this rate
Its good

It's good but only one drawback is over noise at the time of water filtration.
It's good product

"It's good product, Installation was swift, Water purification is good"
It's good products worth to buy it value of money
It's good working. It's very useful for middle class people with reasonable price.
It's gud and working well
"Its is a highly money minded company. Ao Smith water purifier is not only very expensive bt Stops working abruptly for simple change of filter through programming when the last filter change was a couple of months ago. The water we get in out pipeline is already good I.e. hardly any dissolved salts, bt still STOPS working for mere filter change and we have to rely on filter cans.Don't recommend this poor product at all!"
It's is good
"It's just too good. Easy to use, ease to service."
It's looking nice and working well
It's more useful to small family
It's need time to understand how much it is efficient.
Its nice
It's nice and working fine. I liked it
It's nice product. Taste and alcline are good. I suggest everyone to buy this.
Its not even an year I purchased this water purifier and the filters are already damaged. When I called the customer care they said filters are not covered under warranty and one filter can only purify 6000lts of water. So every 10months you have to pay for the filters are get them changed. One of worst purchase I have ever made.
"It's not even an year to the product and RO stopped filtering water. Dealers or service team tells life is complete of the filters in 10 months only due to the chip installed on every filter, now either you buy an amc or buy filters from dealer to continue."
"Its not fully leak proof, insects still go inside. Although mentioned on product description, tds adjuster is not given. Technitian does no explain all features"
"it's not performing well, after use this I have lung infection..."
Its performance is ok. Quality is good. I have purchased it first time in the last month. After using  I will check it's further performance.
It's product is very good and also water quality is good 👍
Its quite good.
It's really good and giving water with ph8..my health improved with this alkaline water
It's really good product.
It's really helpful.
It's so good
It's superb
It's the best budget RO under 15000.
It's the best product in this category.
"It's the best thing you can buy for this price. All the filters with such filtering technologies like alkaline, orp, UV, copper etc are much pricier than this. It bring down the pH from 1100 to 110 in just few minutes. Taste is also good. Also service was excellent. The technician explained the function of each and every filter with approx change date. Although it was chargeable at ₹600, but still very satisfied. Highly recommended."
It's the best water purifier in the market within budget.....it works really well....
It's to good
"It's value for money product, good service timely installation, affordable filters."
It's very awesome experience with the product very nice quality
It's very good
it's very good product.....technician are so good....
It's very nice! Working well
"Its very surprising, i hav old Aquaguard water purifier which works flowless in the pressure available, however for New Aquaguard PRV is needed as per technician. when asked why same brand doesnt need, I was told its old model so doesnt need. Which means Aquaguard technology 7-8 yrs earlier was way better than current product. Also when told i will buy inexpensive PRV, they said they cant install, they will have to fit branded ones only."
It's very useful for our daily life....very nice product and service.... Thankyou pure it
Its working fine
Its working fine and solved my problem of safe drinking water.
"It's working good ,"

Its working good. No Issues.Design also niceThank YouAO Smith
"It's working good.,but not sure that the capacity level is 10 to 12 litre.,looks like 8 litre.,"
It's working well. Design wise its cool. Fully satisfied with this product. Previously I used aquaguard geneous. Now I bought this product. There's a huge difference in price but no difference in product quality. Special thanks to kinsko. ❤️❤️❤️
It's worth buying this water purifier. Taught many options and I purchased this.Very handy to have warm or hot water.Completely satisfied 😌
It's worth the money
It's worthy and working good.
I've been calling service person but turning on
"I've been using it for a few weeks now. It's a great product at this price but there are 2 noticable things which might affect your decision before purchasing-1. Water holding capacity is just 5 litres which is quite less for 3 or more people in a house.2. Push lever is right below the tap so when it returns to its position, it interferes with the water flow and splashes a little everytime. Pull and hold is fine."
"I've been using this product for a week and without any problems as of now.The product is nice, but they charged me 500 rupees for installation. They said that if I do an installation from outside, my warranty will be terminated. In addition, the installation engineer charged me 250 rupees for a one-of-a-kind TAP and requested for trip expenses."
"just after 1 month, giving bad smelling and bitter water."
Just after completing 1year it started to become hang very often with terrible issue with finger print scanner. Also keeps restarting again & again. Display is ruined completely.Not worth it.
Just good and enough for nuclear family
Just got installed...technician was good to explain everything....let's hope for a good experience ahead.
Just install.
"Just installed 1 day ago, no complaints till now, all process till installation was easy and now  i am increasing word so that amazon allow me to post this review, thanks"
Just installed same day but water taste is not good.Thanks
Just received the product. Looks good! Also received a great and prompt complementary installation service. :)
Just that it’s so sleek and simple with super performance. Keep it up
Just third class waste of money
Just to avoid filter water from shop...good for municipal water to filter it ..
K I installed yesterday I like this product good service
Kabhi mat lena bhai log ye model aur ye company ekdam unsuccessful products hai aur usse bhi jyada iska service ghatiya hai.. 1 mahine ke andar hi kharab ho jata hai aur complain karne pe 20 din ke baad aata hai
"Keeps on creating issues from begining. Techician will come and say buy this part replace that part, pay 5000 more pay 2500 more... and this goes on"
"Kent company is maintaining good standards in all RO systems items, and also one of the leading company in the RO system. Good standard and service also good, customer will satisfy, you have to maintain the same standards in future also. Keep it up."
"KENT product never purchase it's warranty promise is fack and service is so bad and technicians have no manners,so never buy kent product"
Kent Services are a scam. Every 7-8 months you get charged 4-5 K just for replacement.

Liked the service of Rohan from well vision enterprises. Prompt service received from Faber. The product is good. Received quick service.
"Likes: Affordable price in comparison to other water purifiers, no or very little noise while purifying water.Dislike: Due to the dark tint of the body, the water level is difficult to see."
Live Pure after sales is worst. They don't care about the customer. Don't buy livepure products.
"Livepure has very pathetic customer service, they are not responding, without calling, closing service request, I was using a livepure on rental basis around 2.5 years, and since last 15 to 20 days I have been following to cancel my subscription and to return the machine and to refund my security deposit, but they are not responding"
"Livepure RO installation service provider is not good, not visit installation place and not received phone call."
"Livpure Allura a very good product,nice service good company , fiture by good long time use low maintenance nice Product"
Livpure bolt RO bahut bekar RO hai....bahut bekar brand hai... 6months hue hain liya tha.... itna regret ho rha hai.... bilkul mat lena.... bilkul honest review de rha hu tumko
"Livpure shows you hell when it comes to after sales service. My tickets are lying there from past 4 months. I called local Livpure office, their customer care support and tried every possible thing but no one shows up. They never pickup customer calls and never shows up to rectify the issue. This is when I have warranty and I’m not sure how the situation would be if I product is out of warranty. I would simple throw off this product and buy which offers better service."
"Look and  feel is very good. Excellent product and a great value for money. Water quality and taste, both are very good."
Look like copper colour but product fully plastic average quality but water taste ok. It's usefull for good thank water only.
"Look wise good, quality fine overall very good."

"Looks good, works good, fits nicely under the counter, overall value of money"
Looks goodNew style
Looks goodSmooth delivery
Looks great in kitchen after installation. Adds value to the overall aesthetics. Water tastes great. A 'good to have' water purifier.
"Looks great. Seamless connection with the UC app to track ro and water health. Best part, NO servicing required! Goodbye random 'sir ro ke servicing ke liye phone kiya tha' calls."
"Looks is good, built and body is okay , test of water is okayish, installation is hassel free, 1  year of free service. 1000 rupee for pre filter.Municipal water input tds 500 and output 45 . Which is very low."
"Looks like a good product. The installation was super smooth, with a very good on-ground installation person (Amit). The only complaint- the installation required a pressure reducing valve (plastic) for which Kent charged me Rs.1100- the cost of a similar product on Amazon is only Rs.300-400."
Looks wise ok but  quantity  is not good  Installation service is good
Lot of problem facing for installation and for regular use
Lot's of problem
Loud voice from the RO
Love my new water purifier. It has such classy design - highly appreciate 2 year warranty offered by Urban Company

Low qality filters use this filter but lukking so good🙁🙆🙍 Gpt and inner products is low colitys
Low quality filter tap water =this purifier water same.  Pls don't buy
Low quality material used by company.
Luved the service and product . The technical person from the UC aalo came the same day to install.Best sync and service from Amazon and UC
M1 and M2 both have water storage capacity and can store water upto 8l. But please be aware that M1 has a tap that can dispense the stored water even if there is no power at home. M2 can’t dispense stored water as it has sensor which doesn’t work if there is no electricity at home.I bought M2 and after installation I got to know this. Hence now I am getting it replaced with M1
Machine because faulty with in 4 months. Service centers are crap. 3rd party service providers. They don't care about your health. Will give 0 rating if any. Call centers are not picking the call.
"Machine looks great in the kitchen. Overall, a good product by Urban Company.The partner Amit was on time and did the installation properly"
Made in India! With excellent installation assistance. I had limited space for the purifier setup and the engineer did a fabulous job. Water is Tasting good as well.
"made my life  much easier, tds levels are okay where Im located,  so this filter works for me  just fine, i will recommend it to people who're staying alone.I have a questions as well, when and how can I change the filter? specially the black carbon balls?"
Maintenance cost is too high yearly once minimum 4k too expensive for middle class not worth for low class family
Mannual book not deliverd
"Marvelous product with features like UV+UF, Active copper technology, Stainless Steel Storage of 6 Lit. And it's not an RO (I'm away from RO).Does not change the taste of water. I think it's very suitable for TDS<200. Using it since last one month and I'm happy with it.One suggestion: A bottle rack may make it more lucrative to purchasers."
Mast hai
Md Anwar good
"Mene ye march me liya hai. But instalation ke bad pani me white powder a raha hai . Mene 10-15 dino me hi complain ki . Company me se 20-25 dino tak koi reply nahi hai. Bar bar inquiry karani padi bad me technician ka call aya nd ask me for the extra charge. Company bilkul hi bekar hai, plz don’t buy this."
Mithlesh mishra has given very good service nd installation and well explained regarding product
Money from value
Money motive for installation
Money worth product
Most economical water purifier with best quality. Design is an added advantage. Looks too good at home. Service is also at par with other highest quality products.
most expensive maintenance
Most worstIt is making lot of noise from last two weeks.purchased just one month back.No service from aquaguard.
"Motor, and adaptor low quality"
Mr. Ravi was very good in explaining the product and smiling.
Mr.Vishwa Gave a Good Introduction About Using the Machine and it's working conditions. Happy with his Counseling. Yet to understand the machine quality
Mujhe bada he acha laga apka product...Kam budget main acha item hai ye or service bhi badiya hai
Multiple area Dents found on tank.Candle not filters properly.Worst quality candles given with filter.I have spent additional 1500 to buy candles in 3 months of usage.

Must recommended water purifier
My cash lost
My friend recommended me and it is worth of every bit
"My profound disappointment with the Kent Excell Plus RO water purifier I purchased for Rs. 15,000 in October 2021 cannot be overstated. Following installation in November 2021, the first sign of trouble surfaced in July 2023 when a persistent beep sound necessitated a service call. In response, I incurred a charge of Rs. 5,500 for the replacement of all filters within a week.However, the respite was short-lived, as the beep sound issue recurred in September 2023. The technician manually silenced it, only for the problem to reappear. This time, Kent insisted on changing the ccb, extracting another Rs. 1,000 from my wallet. The ordeal reached its peak in December 2023 when the machine abruptly ceased functioning. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the motor had succumbed to leakage.The remedy offered by Kent was a staggering quote of Rs. 4,500 for motor repairs. This product, once a significant investment, has proven to be only reliable within its meager one-year warranty period. Beyond that, the quality plummets, rendering it worse than water purifiers from original equipment manufacturers.Compounding the issue is the abysmal service experience. Contacting customer care entails enduring hours of waiting, false assurances of callbacks, and an apparent lack of availability of the senior technician team. In an entire year of service nightmares, not once did I receive a promised callback.Adding insult to injury is the questionable integrity of the service team. When parts are replaced, local substitutes are employed, yet customers are billed for genuine Kent components. Pursuing Kent for resolution becomes a time-consuming and frustrating endeavor, resulting in a draining depletion of both time and finances.Kent seems entirely indifferent to the distress and inconvenience faced by customers. Despite charging exorbitant amounts, they appear to care little about delivering a product of reliable quality or maintaining integrity in service. The once-trusted water purifier has now become a useless, unusable machine.In conclusion, my earnest advice to prospective buyers is to exercise caution. While this product may appeal to those financially well-off and willing to spare no expense, it stands as a cautionary tale for those who diligently earn their money. In the latter case, investing in this product is not just ill-advised but also a potential source of financial regret and frustration."
My purifier start malfunctioning within 6 months of purchase. The technicians were not able to figure out the problem even in 5 visits. They have stopped picking up the phone and the problem still remains. Poor product poorer service 👎
"My relative told me about this product and I have searched for it in Amazon and ordered it. First product was a damaged piece but later recieved the replaced product.The installation of the product was very simple as I need not to fit the pipe fittings. So, I did it on my own replacing my old water filter with Kinsco water purifier.Its been a month now and I am happy with the product.Cons: not too sure if they really have the copper filters but the colour of the filters is copper.Quality of the plastic used on the outer part of product could have been better- but what more one can expect in a product <6000₹"
My tds was reduced
Na
Nano filtration is the requirement and the product fits it.
Native M2. Touch Screen Not Working from Day one.Pathetic experience with product and service.No proper customer support email available. You need to search through app and spend long time to go to help section and then start chatting with a BOT.
"Neat installation and demo, overall product is good"
Need to add alkaline +copper features to this model the models looks good and bring it more colour varients as
Need to change 2 filters every 3-4 months and motor last only 2 years and RO membrane also changed twice its better to Filter with comprehensive warranty as Kent ask for money to change filters . I had to pay money for filters just after 6 months 10 days as filters are not part of 1 year warranty. And then i had to pay for RO membrane after 1 year 15 days . And today motor got dead after exact 2 years 2 months. Better to buy AO smith or Urban company water purifier as they are providing 2 years comprehensive warranty and latest technology as well.
Need to change theGKk within 2-3 months which costs about 6k everytime. So technically can buy new 8 months.
Needed to install a device to reduce water pressure and have added set up to collect the waste water. The purifier works well.
Needs no service for 2 years.Very smart and digital..Pure copper  💦 water.. . . .  ..........
"Never buy like this product, I have purchased after some time product not working."
Never buy the product.
Never ever book any water Purifier fro eureka Forbes.. Firstly their product stop working in 1 month and their customer service is pathetic called so many times but no one contacted me once.. Never expect this from such a huge brand
"Never evwr buy, no service extremely poor quality. Suffering for last 6 months.Now dumping it in garbage and buying eureka forbes"
"Never purchase Kent product because it's warranty promise is fack,and it's services is very bad and technicians have not manners"
New technology and sleek design plus taste of mineral water
"Newly installed -The filtered was shows good TDS range, and tastes good too. Will re-review after 6 months"
"Newly mounted today without any problemsNo damage yet, will see how it works forward"
Next day delivery and the look is awesome. Water taste is good . Within this price range the product is nice

No
NO ! Dont buy !  Sharing this honest review after using this for 10 months ! Overall it’s good looking product ! But  Filter needs regular service (chargeable) . Every 3 month this product will show red light and you have to call service guy !Filter has to be changed in 5 months  which is costly upto 6500 rs !Don’t buy ! Thank me later !
No Artificial flavor is felt at the time of drinking.
"No complaints  about the product.  However, No use buying this product, since you hv to literally  run around the service guys to repair it.  Since eight months the service guy has not attended to the complaint.  Dome chip has burnt out, he said it is in warranty  and replace it, but sorry to say, it was not done. Now he demands 4000 for replacement as warranty  period is over."
No complaints as of now
No cons only pros
No issues Installation has been prompt
No issues so far - works good
No Manual water dispenser. Hot water doesn't work.
No need of replacementProblem rectified.Cancel Replacement order.
No one care ...no one ready to installation all are focusing for sale ..they take too long for installation means how to service in future
"No one contacting for installation, even I complaint two times no use , still installation not done , helpline number also not working, please don't buy this product, there no return option also just waste of money"
"No one responds once u purchaseAmazone says company will install and company don't even bothered about the customer, hell line doesn't work...Very bad experience"
No one turns up from the team for complaint resolution.. no parts are available even no MCB are available for this ACQUAGUARD with Eureka Forbes
No problem working fine
No problems so far. Looks good. Love the product. Installation was quick but the team took some time to respond.
"No proper installation, lot of panel gaps overall a very cheap product which has been installed very improperly.Also no proper service support. Have not used the filter after 2 weeks of installation"
"No proper response from live pure camapany, no service , totally third class water filter, don't buy this useless filter"
no response to emails or call for support
No taste waterWorst Customer care services
No warranty card no manual inside the box... Many scratch spots in filter... I think this is used filter
No water veste product very good 💯😊Iam very satisfied.
No water westage
Nobody will come for installation. You have to install it with your local mechanic.Used it for almost 6 months. We replaced sediment filter its working fine.3rd party spare parts will put properly in this.
"Nobody will respond to customer queries and will not come for service, please don’t buy aquaguard products ..,please please please"
Non usable
Noo bekar haiNot good product

Not a good quality. The motor stopped working after 2 days.
not any support from service provider try maximum time
Not at all good.. for every two months one problem is raising. While buying product they are mentioning warranty but when they come for service they are charging for everything also spares are very costly.
Not bad money worth . installation guide not provided in side the box uv light not showing out side noramal other purifiers uv small light visibility have
Not deliver warranty card and related accessories locked a complain again has to given timeline after 5 days
"Not doing purifying, TDS level and taste of water are same as pre. Wrost product, So Don't waste money. Refund started from last 1.5 Months but Nobody are coming even for pickup."
Not expected this from Amazon and Eureka.The product received was faulty and not working. The technician himself opened the package and was unable to install or fix the issue during installation. Now I am struggling to replace the package and they want to fix the same faulty piece but are not ready to replace with new one. I am currently wasting my valuable time behind customer care. Feels like I wasted my money for purchasing a faulty product.
Not fitting
"Not good, taking more than 2 hours to filter one time tank,3 times call for service in 6 months but not happy with product5 March 2024 There support team help me later and now working fine. 31 March 2024 Again after 1 month machine failed to work ."
Not proper working
Not suggesting this product.
"Not sure how all customers given 5 stars as per my experience after 5 months of usage,water in and out stopped and also for technician visit ,need to pay 350/- for trouble shoot the issue. Over all this is not long lasting product and go for reputed brand."
Not upto the mark.
Not UV only UF and Membrane worst product TDS gives 7 ppm
"Not Value for Many, filter not working properly."
Not working
Not working properly within one month it's stopped working. Waste of money. Can't reach the service centre also. Poor service.
Not working properlyBetter to Replace
Not worth for the price paid
"Not Worth the hype, Seems the review are not honest enough. Did delivery delay of over a week for no reason."
"Not worth the price at all. Too expensive for god knows what reason. The hot water option is useless. It takes too long for the water to heat and even then it’s hardly lukewarm and not hot. Secondly, in less than 2 months, my water purifier is not working. Suddenly the machines light isn’t switching on and so there is no water to drink now. Bad thing is there is no water tank, which means if the machine breaks down or if there is no electricity at home, you will be without water unless you’ve already filled water bottles at home. Regret buying it, honestly!"
Not worth.... Product stopped working after 5 days
Not worthy
Nothing
Nothing to dislike on this exceptIT NEEDS POWER SUPPLY TO DISPENSE WATER.
now product is good and service is very good for installationhope next future service is excellent

On launched date only i ordered this livpure water purifier i really impressed with the overall quality and features of this purifier as it covers all filter stages and I was looking for this type of water purifier only with both copper and alkaline filter
"On the day of installation tap is leaking. Raised issue with UC and it's 6 hours and no response. Thinking of getting better service, chose UC ; On day 0 it gives you problems. Worse you raise an issue and not addressed for hours. Will return this product."
On time delivery and also quick installation
"On time delivery and installation, customer support is very helpful"
On time Delivery and Timely Installation with well Demonstration of usage and Explanation
"On time delivery,installation and product is good"
On time installation done good service provided by.pureit
On time installation done good service provider by pureit
On time installation done... Good!
On time service and support thank you
Once concerned person called for free service.Later no call or communication at at all.
Once the motor is off exhaust pipe water flowing continuously.
Once your product installation done after that there is no service support from havells. Don't buy..... one star also not recommended but there is no minus option.
one candle is broken very disappointing
"One dislike is the tap , should have been design even better, bottles used to stuck on tip of tap"
One month usage so far....Amazon fast Delivery and installation technician is good and gentle... Nice installation and demo... Overall 5 start rating to product....Letz have to see annual maintenance...
"One of best purifier available in market with great features like uv ro and 8 level purification.Installation was fast done on next day by Prem Krishnan, He explained all features and cleared doubts. Overall happy with product and installation, demo"
"One of the best fraudster Company I came across is Urban company. They sell you product claiming many benifits and once you bought the product, they are like, We are never gonna provide you service for anything, not for Installation nor for any Aftersales service. Shameful behaviour and business practice of Uraban company is now seting benchmarks in how pathetic service one company can ever provide."
One of the best in built and working RO filter comparable to famous brand.It would have been better if water storage tank was included.It brings down 650 to 35 TDS in my location.Installation was smooth and instructions are given as and when required so after sale service is excellent.👍👍
One of the best product at this price really satisfied
One of the best product of Aquaguard
One of the best purifier with low budget
One of the best quality
One of the best water purifier.it taste is awesome.Value for money.
One of the best water purifier.Just go for it👍🏻
One of the most cheapest and faulty RO of its category . Design flaw in tap ( keep breaking ) . Untrained customer support . Warranty only cover service so you have to keep paying 300 rupee for tap and 500 rupee for TDS meter every time technician visit home . In fact looks like some kind of fraud in name of online discount .
One of the worst product ever the installation Executive damaged wall its a waste of money water quality is not good at all
one time service instalation
"One week after installation: The water purifier is serving it's purpose, good value for money, and on time installation was provided"
"Online description says it has storage capacity of 15 liter but originally it has only 12 liter , it's totally disappointing ."
Only after 4 months this purifier is useless.  Ro without any company is also better then it.
"Only issue is pricing is quite high when i purchased, now price is reduced, but product is good. Recommended to buy"
Only issue was while ordering I was supposed to ask for installation!!! Which I couldn't locate while ordering... Amazon just asked to call AO Smith to book installation dates!!AO Smith product and service by itself is excellent ..
Only one month purifier got repair not on power is not supply don't go this and service person asking now 500 for visit don't buy it
"Only problem is that when the machine is on  it started more noise & vibrating, so it seems it may fall from the wall."
Only problem very low TDS level far waterEverything else preety good
only problem with wasting water every now and then !!!
Only six month used now pureit service person asking 2150 ₹ for service orelse it won’t work. Throwing this piece of garbage. Please don’t buy.Maintenance more than a Two wheeler that cost 10 times more.
order delivered 15 Days ago but installation person Denied the installation request as its far from there location even Auququard Team support is also not talking this case seriously false commitment giving about installation
Order was delivered on time and the installation was done by pureit on time and the installation person well explained the system .overall very good experience.
"Ordered a new filter with 4 ceramic candles and one of the brand new candle is just leaking water,the water is draining from the top compartment to the bottom one just in a continuous flow as opposed to drop by drop which I think is normal operation.This makes me think about their quality control and reliablilty.This product i think is not worth it and is being overcharged in comparision to price versus the quality we get.Substandard quality."
Ordered as a secondary RO unit for my home. Still working fine as of now.
Ordered frm Amazon. Working well. Looks great. Water taste also fine. It has all the required water purification modules.
"Ordered one for parents. Delivery was smooth. Had to call for installation. Post installation, figured out there is a stream of water continuously leaking from the discharge pipe, despite the pump being off.Wanted an exchange, but Amazon said they can only do refunds, so back it went.Rating 2 for the proposition of 30 months free maintenance, would rate 1 otherwise for poor QC of products.Ironically, parents got another Livpure RO product from R. Digital locally, which works fine."
"Our experience :- Technician: unhygienic they clean filter connector pipe thru mouth as they don’t have tools- customer service is pathetic, no response despite multiple calls more than month now ..- they are not sensitive that their product provides basic necessity (water) to families.Worst after sales .. never go for this product"
Our family enjoys warm water at touch of button every day.
Our in put tds 1850 pure water coming 105 it's good
Our tap water TDS was around 295 (bit scare to drink) & after Installation of Pureit water purifier it came to 24 (feeling safe now).Simple design.Installation team call them self (was not expected)Thanks & Over all good product..
Outer finish can be improve and fitment also can be improve
Outlook of the filter is good. Water taste also good. As of now everything looks good 😊
Output water is creating white particals.no proper support from aqua guard.they are saying this is how it works. No replacement. This product is set with chip which will automatically make filter not work.
Outstanding quality
Over all going
Over all good
Overall a good product to use and it is recommended.one of the best till now.Installation process is also very simple.
Overall a good product value for money
Overall experience is good its been more than a week we're using it. The duration of water filtration takes upto 20-25 min.

Overall satisfied with the Product
Overall the product is good and would appreciate the technician Joshva who did a good job and answered all our  queries patiently and explained about the product and service requirements for seamless usage. Thanks again !!
Overall the product received is good and water taste is also good but service from livpure is very average the service men asked me to cancel pre filter that ordered from Amazon and he said he will fit pre filter from his company side and took extra money howover filter price in Amazon I have ordered is 700 he took 1000 from me overall product is good and I request you to remove first tank as it smell filter smell and use from second storage water..
Overall very good product. Water tastes good. My only concern operations are little hard with touch buttons.
"Overall very nice and unique RO Native 2 is,Just one minus point is in this RO if Electric point or switch not at ON or Electricity gone then RO will not work. Its only working if Electricity there, otherwise NATIVE 2 is good RO for small family.."
Packing was good and I just opened and fixing it but I noticed candle washer is missing.  I didn't expect this now only because of washer I have to return it ..
"Paise kamane ka dhandhe hai , warrenty nahi dete"
Pankaj kumar ji came for fitting..and was very helpful..Didn’t asked for anything extra…Thank you hul
Parts were missing  like screw etc.Has to purchase a part from technician for controlling water flow/pressure.
Pasand
Pathetic customer serviceUnskilled techniciansProduct seems fine so far.Leaking filter.Water indicator is not clear.
Pathetic product. Customer care service is very  bad 👎. I would never suggest anyone to buy such product.
"pathetic service experience, very un professional and low knoledge service engineer, dont buy waste of money.not expectig this form Eureka forbes"
"Pathetic Service, leakage post installation, I spoke with the installation person multiple times but he didn't revisit. I contacted livepure cc but after waiting for 25mins they simply disconnected the call. Really feel bad with their post service."
"Pavan from the vguard team attended my new vguard water purifier installation, he is behaving gentle and did a good service.I'm very much satisfied."
Peoduct is good and installation person was knowledgeable about the product. Very professional
Peore water purifier provides healthy water preserving adequate minerals and lesser wastage of water compared to RO. Nano filters should replace RO. Cost of the Peore water purifier is quite reasonable.
"perfect for family to use aquadpure RO, perfectly installed by technician and machine working perfectly,tase is good, TDS value checked by technician after installation, totally satisfied. thank you team aquaDpure"
"Perfect just. Installation, delivery, and the water taste. It's perfect."
Perfect product
"Perfect product, you just need to take your home to their office for installation and service. Even after confirming on the service availability before purchase, after the delivery the delayed it for a week and now they are saying that the service is not available, you can return the product. Also the return is not available on Amazon for this product, so I have to go through the task of talking with Amazon, raise tickets and so on, and Urban will just clear their hands saying do return it.Great Service Urban"
"Perfect water filter for home at an economic price, affordable service"
Perfectly reduced TDS level to 60 from 900.
"Performance is good, design is very nice"
Performance of the purifier is good but fitting is not good u can just go for it
"Personally i like this product very much, body quality is so good, and filteration quality is also very good , this machine smoothly works on 1860 Tds.... Machine filter water around 140 TDS.... Taste is very good... Silent Operation.... Go for it"
Ph level 9 very well performed
Photo me jaisa copper cylinder dikh rha h aisa real me nhi aayega chota sa laga rhega aur 5L water filter karne me 5L pani girega pipe se aisa banaya h and iski service city me itni kharab h to Village side me kitna kharab hoga pta nhi 4 months pahle bola tha abhi tak inka technician aaya nhi thode thode din me water me dave ka small aane lagta h usko sahi karne ke liye alag se pay karke technician ko bulana padega TDS level sahi karne ke liye inka koi bhi banda nhi aayega sirf bolte h ki mai kisi ko bhejta huAmazon me bhi complain kar chuka hu vo log bhi kuch nhi kiye
Pior
"Please check the TDS of water before buying. If TDS is more than 1500, it can't reduces tds lower than 200...so if you want tds around 150 then it is not a good RO. My old RO was able to give TDS lower than 150 with local membranes...."
"Please do not buy this product, after every few months one or the other part gets damage and this company will charge you extra money even though the product is under warranty.Trust me you will feel helpless because machine stops poring water also."
Please don’t buy this product .. purifier stopped working after 15 days of the usage.. pleas go for better one
Please don’t buy this product by choosing look wise and star rating.. the Build Quality of the product is cheap plastic material and it makes sound.. previously I have Kent water purfier which is excellent no issues.This time I thought to buy something new and now I am not at all happy with this product. Please skip this while choose. Better to choose other
Please don’t buy this product.With in span of 5 months the motor stoped working and the main bad thing is service unable to provide service engineer.we need to call customer care daily to request service engineer.
Please don’t buy within a year everything stops working and extended warranty doesn’t cover anything .. I am paying 3k every year for this which itself was 4k
Please don’t purchase from here they don’t provided any help after purchase. product also defected I need to return that.
"Please don't buy HUL product, I have experiencing bad service from them. Selling the item is more important than the service"
Please don't buy KENT RO GRAND STAR IT IS NOT WORKING SINCE INSTALLATION WORST PRODUCT AND SERVICE KENT CLOSED CALL UNILATERALLY WITH OUT INSPECTION AND REPLACE/RETURN STILL PENDING
Please don't buy stay away from this seller and product
"Please don't buy this cheap product, it has a faulty design and bound to break down sooner or late. The company doesn't own any responsibility of the product post sales, they want customer to pay money for every repair by their technician even if the fault is in their product."
"Please don't buy this product and waste your money. On the first day itself it caused so much of noise and somehow the technician sorted out and left. On the second day, the same noise and the tank started leaking heavily and continued through the wastage pipe as well. When I called the customer care, they said it will 24 hours to send thier technician. They connected me with someone and his mobile was switched off even the next day. On the first day the TDS was around 120, and on the second day the TDS turned to 218. Finally I had to switch off the device each time, and request to replace the device. The replace request was accepted but it was not delivered. They have a worst customer care service.Regarding meintenance, the spare parts are available only at Pureit and only their technicians will have to come and fix it.Buy once and you will feel sorry forever."
Please don't buy this product. .. Within one month it got repaired and the customer care people are not helping out with warranty. They say online brought purifier will not cover warranty. .. To repair also they are charging more.
Please dont buy this product. The after sales service is pathetic. Customer care is also not responding.
Please don't buy this product. Within 5 days it got non-functional. There is no any support/service from company for repairing. Even they don't pick up call and respond. It seems a fraud company which is selling online by fooling customer. I wasted money by purchasing it.
Please don't buy this product.It is getting repaired frequently.Also aquaguard service is very worst.
"Please don't buy this, firstly i purchased last month, but it got delayed for almost 1 week from the original delivery date, then took 2 more days for installation, once installed we found that it has leakage in the water dispenser, then again took 1 week for replacement. Now 2 more days for installation then now we are finding a weird plastic taste in the water which is been filtered from this water purifier. I almost wasted 1 month behind this. Please don't buy it. Go for some other brand."
Please don't go for Livpure worst after sale service ever
Please don't purchase this product. It's manufacturing quality is worst. Within 3 months I faced two issues. One is due to level switch and second is tap of purifier.Physical components will not be covered in warranty need to pay for physical components.
Please return it. I wasted my money in installationHorrible experience
Plenty of water goes as waste. For 1 litre of water almost 10 litres of water goes as waste.Better ask for the service person to give a long drain pipe so you can use it for other household things.Service/ maintenance cost is extremely high around 3-4k per everytime for the filter or some motor stops working.Better go for some other options in regular filter.Even after spending 18k on a filter you need to install external filter which will also change on every service & it costs around 1k.Total waste of product you need to call the service centre guy every other time. Not paid review used for 1 year & writing the review.Even after seeing the review if you want to buy it. It's like you are the chicken & walking into KFc.
Pls check product
Polite quick. Good explanation
Poor customer service do not go for Pureit its been more than 3 days but complaints are not responded on time and you ll end up in trouble without water
Poor installation... didn't install prefilter yet! Just saying will be available tomorrow!Worst service by Havells... better go for different brand
"Poor performance, Water is not even getting filtered. Every day need to clear the membrane before water filling.Wastage of Money and Time.. Buy an electric purifier only."
Poor quality it left smoke after one month
Poor quality not working this Aqua guard today 1st day received
"Poor quality parts, in just 6 month changed few parts"
"Poor quality plastic, had to install item guard separately"
"Poor quality product, the case which hold water is already cracked and falling apart near the screw fitting area. The cut off switch connection was not connected, poor quality of plastic and setup"
"Poor Quality products, low life poor quality filters, won't even work for 3 months, got frustrated calling for repair...in 12.months Warrantee period machine open for 8 times...still no permanent resolutions, have more than 25 complain numbers, now forcing me to take AMC the only they will repair or pay for repair....not at all serious for customer complain"
Post installation in 1 hour it stopped working and Amazon’s agents are fooling around when I place replacement on 2nd April they told it will be done on 5th and no one visited to picked up now they  are saying the return window is closed so sorrySuch a bad experience and very bad services I paid such a huge amount in one shot for wast product and serviceAm suffering to get the replacement  I need the solution
PP filter kit was missing and water conectors have leakage issue hence all these issues occurs extra cost to customers.
"Prduct installed very effeciently. Smart look, matching with my kitchen. Water quality good TDS below 100.Warranty  6 months on electrical parts and not included membrain and others.Overall satisfied."
Prduct is good and the technician who came to install we're professional and completed the work with clean installation quickly
Pre filter not available with pack. They didn't think pre filter as a part of filtration process.
Pretty good product for the price
Price ki hisab se product mast hai
Price of the product and the quality is good .
Prima facia a good well designed product and quick and efficient installation by Ravi raj PK.
"Pro - LooksCons:-1.Flow of water is slow.2.Tap is placed quite high; preferably it could have been placed at the lower edge. The tap design is flawed. In the current design, the lever stays just below the outlet and it has to be lifted up to ensure continuous flow of water and it has to be pressed towards the body to ensure regulated flow of water. But when you put lever from top towards its original position or leave the pressed tap suddenly to its original position to stop flow of water, it fouls with the flow of water leading to spillage.3. Water wastage is much higher as compared to Kent supreme plus."
"Problem TDS not set properly when When I set it at 150, then after a few hours it comes below 50 down  try 5 times but this problem Facing"

"Product - is Amazing for Borwell water, totally changes the taste of water after filtering.

Product Is good and need to mention on Installation part. Thanks for your work from Sp Enterprise's (Hemesh) too good person and the explanation of the product was also too good . Thanks again Mr Hemesh.
"Product is good and quality too. Product received on time and installation also done on time. No delay or no problem. Machine working good and water taste and smell and colour all good. The one and only problem I faced is after installation done one full storage tank water is removed out by installation engineer request and again one full rank is filled but even though tank filled the outlet of waste salt water doesn't not stop. What installation engineer told means when water storage tank full the machine will automatically will offer and after that 5 to 15 minutes later the water salt water will stop. But for me the waste salt outlet water doesn't even stop for 2 days continuously running. I registrated complete to proven company,next day itself they came and check and solved that problem. Now working so good. I recommend everyone can buy this. Because in this machine we have alkaline, negative orp, tds eltc. This is good for health and maintaining immunity level"

Product is nice and good
"product is not good and it is not working at all, don’t buy, and service is also not good they are not even responding properly"
Product is of good quality and no problems till now...
product is ok but take instalation charges
"Product is okay but after sale is very bad.Recently my RO was serviced by there technician and product was under warranty.During service, it got cracked by technician and since crack was in middle part of tank and not easily visible. I didnot observed untill it started getting leakage.Additionally he keeps on asking for buying ACMC for next one year for which i have paid 5500/-Now getting is repaired is getting costlier as this is not easily available and they are not able to cancel ACMC as well. There service manager won't pick the call as they know if they are getting call, its for complaint only.So i will suggest to not buy if you don't want to struggle with after saleEdit 1: Resolving your issue with Customer Care or service Area manager is very tidious. If you want to cancel or need support, they will simply delay the process. I want to cancel ACMC purchased during service and they are not able to cancel. They are just buying time so that once ACMC gets applied to my account, then they will say its already applied.Edit 2: After following up from last 15 days, now they are saying its applied and call Service manager, but he didnot received the call. Got fooled by them. I will say avoid this product or try not to get another ACMC. Better go with some other product than this"
Product is on time delivery and on time installation. like it 👍
"Product is out of order within 6 months, no response from customer cell, not able to contact manufacturers or seller to claim warranty."
Product is really amazing ..Looks nice and quality is also up to the mark..

Product is so classy as well as working fine as of now.
"Product is still running good, no complaints. But I would not be getting Eureka Forbes product anymore. I had first few service for free, yet nobody bothered!Instead I got a message to rate their service out of 5"
Product is super looking. Every one is asking where u get this. All black design with both matte and gloss combination with touch panel and led ring light all r great looking premium design.But the installation was not so good the installation person doesn’t have any idea about the product. He was calling someone and asking every step for installation and he went before checking the  taste of water after complete installation.
"Product is to good, easily can assembly."
Product is too good...
Product is value for money
"Product is very bad in quality. The product I received was defective so got that replaced. Also they did not came for installation and i had to get the installation done myself by paying extra to local plumber. The later one also started having issues after a month of use. The worst part is their service, it's been 10 days of raising a service request and escallating many times but no response from them.Strongly suggest not to buy any product from this manufacturer."
Product is very defective and they are reluctant in providing services after selling their product
product is very good
"Product is very good ,in terms of usage and built quality.Only drawback is that storage water dispenser not work during powercuts."

Product looking good but not working properly. 1st time adaptor not working and get product replaced and  2nd time also not get good  water from waste line is going everytime after fileter tank full it's not auto cut.
Product looks are  attractive and is at par with other major costiler brands giving same water quality. I have been using since 4 months without any issues.
"Product looks good when it comes with alkaline water, without electricity use store water mean some filter worksalong with electricity and"
Product looks good with features loaded and working good. Will recommend to others also.
Product Materials Quality is very Low Plastic
"Product may be good . But waiting for installation , with no way to contact technician. Thought service and installation will be positive thing for urban clap. Dissapointed"
Product may be good. The first set of filters worked 11 months. Input water is about 1000ppm. They market with free service for 4 years and it is. But they sell Prefilter at Rs 650 at every visit. they try to sell in bulk buy 6 you get 7th free. What is the cost of 6 filters at Rs 650. It's almost same price as the filters internal to the machine for a year. This is how they recover free service and balance any loss on AMC which is forced on us siting the hardwater we have now a days. The technician said my machine is small for this level of hardness. Future buyer beware: No one told that this machine will not work when I bought it or when they force sold 4 years of AMC. first service after AMC all of a sudden recommendation is to buy a bigger machine. Awesome. Take customer for a ride and make profit. Next machine is not Kent.
"Product ok ok hai jyada kuch khas nahi hai uper se installation wale jaha marji waha install kr dete hai, change krne ko bolo toh extra charge lagega fir bolte hai extra pre filter lagwao 1100Rs ka"
product performs as per expectation. Few hiccups since bought but service was prompt to resolve those issues.
"Product quality & Design is the best, On time Installation done, Perfect technician Mr jeya prakash he did good job, But i didn't expected extra pre filter charges Rs.900 I pay separately, purifier good working condition, noise is less,Water quality and taste have not yet been investigated"

Product was very nice.Prompt Delivery & Installation.Nice water filter..
"Product works perfectly as expected. Installation was done as communicated.Been one month since we are using it, absolutely no issues or concerns. Best in this price range."
Product works well. Worth buying.. Installation was done on time as well...
Product worth the money..
Product ठीक है परन्तु Service बहुत बेकार है।
"Product, Delivery, service was good and prompt, I bought it in sale at great price"
Product: Aqua Grand Plus RO + UF + UV + TDS Control 12 Liter Water Purifier. It is not working properly three months after purchase.
Professional installationWorks great
Prompt and hassle free installation by installation executive Mr Samiran Giri
Prompt delivery & installation and working fine. 👏👏
Prompt installation from the team explaining all the details….delivery was timely …..overall excellent experience
"Prompt installation, installed the same day:)"
Properly work
"Pros - Lightweight, good taste of water, all-in-one solution at much lower price than other brandsCons - No indicators to show when one or more filters need to be replaced, so user has to remember replacement time for some of the filters (except for UF). Also, only 1 m wire provided for connection to socket."
Pros: Look and design of the filter is very good.. But that is the only good thing.It is claimed by the company that After filtering about 6000 litre of water you will have to replace all the filters.Reality: Its been only 1 year and i had to get my filters replaced twice.. The filters are very costly. You'll be charged around 4 to 5 thousand every time you get the filters replaced.And to add to that pureit HUL has the worst customer support system. There is no toll free number to call them. They have a very strict 9 to 5 schedule from monday to Saturday. Only during that time you can call. The calls are chargeable even if you have recharge. And you'll have to reply to computerized response for 2 to 3 mins just to talk to customer support person.
"PROS:1. No AMC cost for 2 yrs. only rs.4500/- for next 2 yrs.2. Amc covers everything and service is pretty good. Technician was well informed.CONS:1. I opted for M2 model due to mobile app but the app is not useful. We need to do the set up every time & the info available is very basic.2. We cannot use the stored water in case there is no electricity.3. The machine is opaque not transparent. Not a negative thing but we just wont know if the water is filling well etcFINAL VERDICT:Undoubtedly the machine is better than the best brand available in the mkt but I strongly suggest buying the cheaper M1 model instead of M2. M1 will work without electricity too. You will miss out only on app, which is anyhow useless."
Pros:1. Refills water under 10 minutes.2. Stainless steel water tank.3. Water is clear and the taste is appropriate.Cons:1. Cheap plastic build.2. Water dispensing is slow.3. Water tank storage less than 5L.
Proven RO stoped working after 2 months.. i am trying to contact customer again and again.but not getting any resolution.
"Proven water purifier is a quality product. Very fine working, no feature is left which you think that your water purifier doesn't have. I am very happy after buying this. Thanku proven"
Provides good features on affordable amount which are very useful
"Purchage the same product keeping in mind pure water with minerals, as on date it is fulfilling the commitment later how long it performs to be observed."
Purchased 3rd unit for my home
"Purchased from Amazon, delivered fast, product is good and installation is also very smooth, the person who came for installation is very polite and explained the details of product very nicely.Overall experience is really nice"
"Purchased Glo Pro ++ purifier. Delivery is fast with Amazon prime in a day. After a week usage, giving review.Product is looking cute & small with 7L capacity. It will take 30 minutes to full tank. Tap water coming fast and clean.Cons:1. Need to purchase external filter separately for 1200 rupees including service charges. 2. Observed a small crack on the outer dom even though packing was good.3. Got to know from technician that every year this needs maintenance around4000 rupees.Overall happy to purchase the LivPure."
"Purchased in March 23 . Within 10 months it stopped working. Customer service is very pathetic.It seems Havells don't bother or it doesn't have good network of customer care. Whatever the issue may be but I suggest don't buy it . You will regrate. There is no rocket science in water purifier machine, even local made Water purifier will perform same process. it is filter,which purifies the water not the company. So better go for local machine and opt for a simple machine."
Purchased it for my hostel use. TDS reduced from around 850 to 54 ppm. So all in all a nice budget friendly product.
Purchased recently. Very much satisfying with the water purification with alkaline nature adjustment.Very good.  Best in alkaline adjustment and purification.
"Purchased the filter, was delivered in time and was fitted by Ratan, kinsco tech rep. Did s good and fast job. A year ir so now and am pleased to say the unit is working just fine.Highly recommended"
"Purchased the product through Amazon on 2nd April and received one day delivery through prime. The installation was seamless and done within two days.The product design and quality is good and so far has not given any problems in the first two weeks of use. Water purification has been decent enough and the taste of water is good.Overall, satisfied with the product and its operations so far."
Purchased the water filter some weeks back...works perfectly... very effecient.Good installation service...hassle free!
Purchased this product hardly two months back and it has started giving issue… water is hardly coming and now it takes 3-4 hours to purify 7 L water… when we got installed this it was taking 15-20 mins only… have registered complain and will edit this review on the basis of response.. before this I always use to go for local vendors and service use to be seamless.. let’s see how they respond
"Purchased this product recently. It worked fine for one month. But later water stopped purifying. Water stays in the upper compartment but wouldn't purify into the lower compartment. Even after the cleaning, the problem won't resolve. Very bad experience."
Purchased this product twenty days ago and is working good and it's quality is good.
Purchased twice. Good product. Works well. Installation done on time.
"Purchased water filter 2 weeks before, TDS showing 30, which is very low as per water quality, company claimed it must be 50 to 150,Called service person, they found that TDS adjuster is not installed in this model,Not sure whether this machin is faulty or wrong product order, as per discription it shows smart TDS adjuster, but it failed to maintained appropriate tds level,Hope company should write the clear instructions in the specifications,"
Purchased Z9 best product working fine.If no power you can't take water. Go for z8 if you have frequent power cuts.
"Purchased/ delivered on 29.09.2023.Registered complaint on 30.01.2024 vide No. CO349625440 with Pureit.Motor noise noticed and not working, compliant lodged no one from pure it agency attended till date"
Purchases November 2023After 06 month not properly workingAnytime stop and start bad product not buy this water filter
Pure water
PureIt always provides best services.
Pureit person Installed it very nicely and timely
"Pureit simply applying marketing technique with this product on purchase we have to spend around 14k,after 1year ,every year need to spend 5k for GKK/Filter changes,,simply looting."
Pureit's Great RO offers exceptional filtrations providing pure and healthy water at an unbeatable price. Truly the best budget-friendly choice
purely water contains and good to taste and comfortable to use and drink
Purification and TDS
Purified Kits spares cost is very expensive where they charge minimum 4K to 4.5K per visit and valid only 9-10 Months and in between filter is needed to be changed once in a 4-5 months alone.
"Purifier does not leak, build quality is fine, since it's UV only cannot measure ppm change or filtering quickly. Pre filter is additional if required you can buy from installation person."
Purifier is too good.Material is sturdy. Water taste is also nice. I will definitely recommend to purchase it. just go for it.
"Purifier is too good.Material is sturdy. Water taste is also nice. I will definitely recommend to purchase it. just go for it.Shiva ganga has installed the product,responded  very well also explained about the product in detail. I defenitely recommend to buy this product."
Purifier is working good. Service is good.
Purifier process is nice
Purifier Stopped working from 3rd Day itself.Continuesly sending messages to support team and they are not responding properly.I did a mistake to buy this product
Purifier working as expected as of now.
Purifier working is good
"Purifier working is good, no noise while purifying, looking stylish.."
"Purify is good working fine, plastic quality is not so good even tap also, there is so many quality products is there in offline"
Purifying water while we can adjust the tds level. Recommended product for families as it have a big storage tank
Purity of drinking water is excellent... Recommended.... 8 way of purification...... Worth for money....
Purity of water nice
Quality and performance 👏 👌
Quality and service wise excellent.. anyone who thinking of buying RO water purifier.. can choose V guard.. compare the price with other brands also service warranty..
Quality and sturdy product
Quality can be improved
Quality is awesome

"Quality is good. easy to install, but their customer care service is very bad. They didn't come for installation."
Quality is not good
Quality is the best for all purification mention this purifier but service man is not cooperative.
Quality is very good
"Quality is very good ,service on time"
Quality is very poor amazon doing fraud
Quality of the product
Quality of the Purifier & material is best. Water taste is really good.. Service is excellent. Could have been a better if there is tds controller in it and more storage capacity.
Quality of water filtered is not good.
"Quality of water is good, easy usage"
Quality product and service.
Quality product but price is little higher
Quality product good service
Quality product with value for money
"Quality purify, water test very nice and proven installation is fast I like. I'm very happy with this product. Low price purifier so go for it"
"Quality, value for money easy to install"
Quick and easy to install. Decent installation support from the local agency associated with PureIt.User needs to register first to initiate the installation process
"Quick and effective installation, very professional and well mannered executive"
Quick and excellent installation by Mr. Satish from pureit.Well guided with operations.
Quick delivery and installation. Nicely briefed by technician.
Quick filtration.. I believe fastest among all brands.(28l/hr) (My first priority due to limited time supply of drinking water). Very fast discharge.I am Pureit customer since 8 years and will continue to do so.
Quick installation and good demo and explanation by Raghuvendra
Quick installation and great work done
Quick installation by company after delivery...
Quick installation by Piyush.
Quick installment no problem
Quite compact to fit under sink and leave space for a bin. And works perfectly
Rajkumar installed RO and provide good service.
"Rating: ⭐️I recently purchased an Aqua Guard water purifier, and the experience has been nothing short of a disaster. The company claims to provide timely service, but here I am on the 5th day without any progress on the installation front.The installation process has been an absolute nightmare. Despite multiple assurances of prompt service, I am left with a non-functional water purifier in my kitchen. It seems like the company's definition of ""timely"" is light years away from what the rest of us understand.To make matters worse, the lack of communication from Aqua Guard is astounding. I haven't received a single update regarding the installation status. It's as if my request for service has fallen into a black hole, never to be acknowledged or addressed.I tried reaching out to customer service, but that proved to be a futile exercise. The representatives seem to be either clueless or indifferent to the customers' concerns. It's infuriating to be treated with such negligence after investing in their product.I would strongly advise against purchasing any Aqua Guard product if you value your time, sanity, and the reliability of the company's promises. This has been a regrettable experience, and I am seriously reconsidering my decision to choose Aqua Guard over other brands. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for a water purifier that actually delivers on its promises."
"Reached in time ,explained everything,good work"
really a good product
"Really appreciable, budget friendly and best RO water filter.Thanks proven"
"Really bad product, motor stopped working within 6 months. When we raised service ticket, they are asking for 4500 for filter change as it is not covered in warranty. Service guy told us, usually it takes 6k per year to maintain this RO. Better to buy new one than changing filter every 6 months."
"Really good in this budget, great service instant installation done by Rinku, really helpful"
Really good product
Really good product in this budget am really happy with it. Becoz of water taste. Really good
Really good water purifier with a hassle free and quick installation. Great value for money product .
"Really like my new water purifier. Premium design, great aesthetic and love the retractable tray feature - keep me hand free while using the machine"
"Really liked the product, Specially the hot and boiling water dispensing feature."
Realy very good
Reasonably priced product
"Received a defective item, was repaired.after installation exactly after using one year it started beeping sound  it's merely used around 3000 litres.that to after replacing two pre emptive filters what's the point in it it's asking for replacing filter membranem.hope vguard doesn't loose its trust."
Received a faulty piece. Been more than 1 month since I raised complaint but Eureka Forbes is not replacing device. Avoid this brand. Eureka Forbes as a brand recently is not keen or even trying to keep its promise
"Received couple of days back but installation was scheduled today. The technician was helpful and informative, he suggested us to install the pre-filter for the longevity of the purifier. He charged us 1270Rs for the prefilter and its accessories. The tap water tds is around 530 and the filtered water is around 65. The taste of water is also same as compared to the can water. The water wastage is in 1:2 ratio, for every 1 litre of purified water, around 2 or 2.5 litres is rejected. Will update the review after longterm usage"
Received damaged product
Received Damaged Products like Tuta Futa 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧😷😷😷😷
Received defect product and after installation external filter also leaking continuously..feeling upset on this...
"Received in good condition, and also working properly"
"Received in good condition.Installed and working fine.Budget friendly, value for money.I strongly recommend."
"Received it in a good condition but UF Membrane not working properly, water comes down very fast."
Received the product fast and installation was done the next day which was smooth thank you amazon but the person tooked 150₹ in the name of RO pipe connector which I feel was given by the comapany so  feel he charged me unnecessarily extra there and water storage capacity shown is 7 litres but after it gives 5-6 litres maximum which is not enough for big families
Received the product with good quality and timely installation assisted.good value for the cost thank you
"recently got AO Smith under the counter RO water filter and we are very happy with it is value for money and provides clean and pure drinking water, it is a good option if you are going for modular kitchen."
"Recently got installed , one of its kind with additional futures like alkaline ,zinc and copper content in final out put water , TDS reduced from 160 to 15 after installment.Customer service was quick to addresss the leakage through sediment filter  which was seen after instalment, all in all a money worths for additional features.."
"Recently I purchased this product, the installation is good, and product is working as expected"
Recently purchased aqvadwater purifier.. Nice product... Installation staff also supportive... Really value of money
Recently purchased Kinsco make RO and product is really good in terms of water quality and budget friendly. Thanks Kinsco team keep up the good work.
Recently purchased this and am satisfiedProsDesignPriceFeaturesConsA small copper is available inside and advertised as all are copper insideInstallation charges of ₹700/-Quality of internal filter was not gr8
Recently we purchased Ao smith water purifier and we are completely satisfied with the product. We are making use of the outlet water for  bathing & washing clothes. Once you start saving that water you will be surprised with the litres of water you conserve. Nice product indeed!
Recheck product dimensions given thereat depicts size fit in hand.I am sure that dimensions mentioned are not accurate.Am I Right?Do u agree
"Recommended not to go for AMC as the service of Eureka is very poor unlike Kent..  Firstly they insist for having AMC and when u take the AMC no one is gonna to listen you.. After taking the AMC, technician advised for filter change and since 4 days no one comes for filter change.  On asking from technician assinged for the same informing that eureka  is not sending filters that's why they are fail in completing the service.  In one word u take AMC and forgot to have water from machine for several days as it stops filtering water water reaching prescribed limit.....  Very worst service now experienced by me also among other consumer.  ......"
Reliable brand and dependable productModel: Zenora RO+UV+Mineral: Black Thnx Amazon received the product on time and installation the same on time also. The water taste was good and the design of the product is amazing. Many thnx the service engineer who installed my RO. He if very soft spoken and did the installation process very well. He is a very professional and he also explyme about the product usage.I highly recommend for the product without any hesitation.

"Right after opening the package we saw that it did not have a tap and other items that are supposed to be in there as per the Images shown in the website. No tap, 5m pipe, taflo tape, and no diverter Valve."
Right now present world HAVELLS  ALKALINE WATER PURIFIER IS A TOP PRODUCT I CAN SAY.WATER TASTE IS WONDERFUL.I THINK ALL THINGS SATISFIED BY CUSTOMER ONCE THEY START USING IT.
RO + copper
Ro +copper
"RO automatically switches on even when the tank is full, I called pureit representative they said its working fine but RO does not switch on itself"
Ro costed me arnd 10k however only in six months i have ended up spending 2900 which is 30% cost of Ro.Membrane of Ro is not functioning properly for which they asked 2500 as a replacement cost plus every 3 months a candle gets changed which costs u 350 so another 1400 for an year. 1 year warranty comes with product however i dont know for whatI request amazon team to plz ask pure it team to get in touch to resolve this issue
RO delivered in good condition and it's awesome..
Ro is good but making to much noise company should look after this & work on it because it's created disturbance
RO is OK but need to install TDS controller separately which cost more than 1000 Rs and after installing TDS controller that is also not working properly. TDS is getting decreased continuously.
RO is perefct for home needs. Added copper adds good taste to water and alkaline feature really helps.
Ro is very good
RO membrane rs 3500 ...every 4 months have to replace it ...go for another brand ..kent worst and hema Malini also
RO plus Copper

"Satisfied with this filter, purify water verry well"
Satisfied with this product.
Seems fine.
Seems like a sturdy product...The water tastes good...Installation process was smooth...Overall good experience so far
"Self might be a single consumer, but Kent is not up to quality and their filter gives up within 1.4 years and it replacement will cost 4300.00 rs and some carbon element will cost another 1300.00 rs. Total 5600.00 rs , Service cost extra.Thing is that first spend 15000.00 rs on new one and after a year or so spend more 6000.00 rs to keep it working.This Kent RO is making fool of customer."
"Seller delivered damaged product leading to leakage of water. However, due to our immediate requirement, it was repaired by a local technician. The product is completely ok to be purchased at this price."
Seller have sent us a defective unit.Where filter sensor was not working and water was flowing out from the above.We asked company for repair they took 2 months and still they says part not available yet.Asking for replacement then they say we can only repair the unit under warranty won't be able to replace the product.Worse ever experience for buying this product.
"Sensor failure, plumbing leakage, cockroach enters into water storage.. replaced sensor, top lid.. all with in 6 months of purchase... not recommended machine.."
Sent old defective unit returned with photos. Showed to Amazon  delivery person as well.
Sept 2023 purchase and till now I have registered 12 times service call because of product RO supreme is not working properly very poor performance....AMAZON Kindly replace......
"Serves the purpose, steal deal at this price range .Customer support is good , installation was professional and it is chargeable. Worth every rupee u spend on it . I would recommend to go for it without any thoughts ."
Service
Service agent every time come and tells us change filters for no reason. They did not have enough knowledge.Irony is that filters are not part of warranty so company always pushes us to buy new filters .Do not trust Aquaguard and become victim.
"Service and filter cost high, rest ok"
"Service and installation was amazing, best water purifier in small budget"
Service by Eureka Forbes is very satisfactory.
Service by shahal was perfect and satisfied 100%
Service done by Shahal was excellent. External pre-filter replaced as promised. The water filter is working well with no issues. Satisfied with the service experience.
"Service engineer visit & Installed, but product specifications not discussed with us. & Also working operation procedure not explained. (2) Also when product arrived, we have found TDS meter, but when service engineer comes to installation not found TDS metre. Customer satisfaction not good, please request to you informed him to re-visit & explain about this product& operation."
Service executive is explained well about product usage and clear all our doubts.
Service for installation provided and working well
Service for Pureit was good.

"Shows low pressure, but techinician resolved it"

Simple Efficient & User friendly RO water Purifier sytem with Alkaline Water is Amazing & Healthy Choice for your Life
"Simple RO. Misguiding by saying alkaline water purifier. Even service engineer could not explain how to get  alakaline water.As a RO water purifier,it is good but don't know why saying about alkaline water."
Simple to install and working reqlly nice
Simply superb
Simply superb for better health.
"Since 2 months the machine is not working I call & mail for it everyday what I have 100% will come today but no one comes company does not provide service.  I wasted peace, you did not waste peace.  It is better to bring a local company than this company"
"Since the product is newly installed, hence will provide complete review after atleast 3 months of use. So far it's good."
"Sleek Design, fits well under the counter, water taste is good. A little difficult to maneuver in tight places."
"Sleek design, simple mechanism and perfect results"
"Sleek design, The water quality is nice too."
"Sleek, modern design. All essential components provided with product - pre filter, connector etc. quick installation by the technician"
Slight sound is there when the machine is started.Installation was quick.
Slow filtration
Smbs problems
Smooth installation. Product is good.
So after using more than 1 year I realise product is up to the mark . But maintenance of this product is costly.You have to spend 5200 rs after using 6k liter water.So basically in normal use. It will take around 1 year to change all internal parts.
"So amazing, really enhance water taste"
So far has been good. The size of filter is bigger than expected. But no issues.Will keep on updating further.
So far it is good . Good product . Convincing price
So far it is working good...no issues at all.
So far no complaint. Doing good.
So far no complaints. It looks elegant. Simple in operation. Quality of water is good.I hope it will serve and meet the Quality standards
So far no issues. Good to buy
"So far the product function and quality seems amazing. Overall until date, product is awesome."
So for its running gud. No complaint
so nice
So noise
"So this one has a steel tank which is good the worst part is there are gaps between the tank and cap and if you have insect issues in your apartment anything can go inside,we started to clean tank everyday morning after realising but the above pic you see there is a gap of merely 4 days when we went out of station, this has got worms now. We raised a ticket , and the guy said ma'am everyone who has bought this product and has pest issues have same problem you could have bought the plastic container product then steel one , we can put a cello tape to close the tank but then you cannot open the cap.So we now clean purifier everyday to get purified water, so much for a 16k product."
Some issues post installation as one day water was not filtering for 3-4 hours. Don't know if it was a temporary issue or long term. I will review it properly after using 3-4 weeks.
Sooper product and affordable price
"Special thanks to Sangeeta from Amazon team to help with arranging technical service. Delivery was prompt and secure as expected by Amazon. However there was a delay in installation. The politeness, knowledge and quality work of technician Suresh was impressive and hence the update in review. At last the device is up."
Speed
Sri vn enterprisesTechanician- Thulasi ram
Staff very unprofessional.Only buy this product if you want to deal with weeks and months of stress to get anything done.They wont sell you AMC because no service available but Faber will sell you the filter anyways.Product description not accurate.Servicing not available.
"Starts leaking from second day of installation, worst service"
Stay fit keep hydrating your body
Stopped within 3 months and the big headache is with the service. Worst service I have ever seen. I have registered a service 10 days but no one has come to repair the product. Please don't buy aquaguard products
Stopped working in 15 days of installation. Literally no credible customer care to approach. Have to rely on small middlemen companies and sales personal who ask for extra commission to do the job. Although produ t is in warranty.Took extra 2000 for installation. Stopped working after 15 days. Now the are not reachable.Kindly don't buy such absurd product with minimal presence in the Indian market. Won't get any service
Stopped working in 4 months. Filters are okay. Technician said fuse failed. He replaced fuse. It worked just for once and stopped again.
Stopped working in a week only
Stopped working in a week.
Stopped working in less than 2 months and service personnel do not visit. Do not buy
Stopped working post 15 days after buying.It's more than a week and after continuously raised complaints no one is coming for customer support.
Stopped working within 3 months (i.e. 75 days) from the date of installation.Technician demands Service charge even if it is within warranty period.Would recommend not to buy this product.
Storage need to consider based on usage
Storage tank is pure plastic. Leaving that aside the product is very good.

Supob
Support from the company is worst. My product stopped workings after 2 months and after multiple complaints there is no resolution
Surprised to see tank got leakage all of a sudden and made a dent on your buying decision this costliest RO.2 technician visited to check the issue ab dismantled the whole RO bit did not notice damage in body.I finally inspected the back side of the body and found water is coming out from the back side of water tank.It clearly shows company is not using good quality of plastic that are more vulnerable if RO is wall mounted.Now I am being asked to pay for replacement since warranty is over.It's clear matter of cheating and fraud.
Surya did an excellent job of installation and is a good resource for the company. I have recommended your product to 4 others in my retirement home complex.
"Takes 40 minutes to fill the tank.The biggest disappointment for me is that the water purifier can send the discharge water to Overhead tank only within 15 feet (OH tank should just be only 1 floor above yours). The sole purpose of my purchasing this product was to minimize the wastage of water.Unfortunately, the underground sump is positioned in such a way that the discharge water cannot be routed there as well.Hope this info could be useful to future purchasers.I request the Kent team to highlight the 15 feet distance restriction in the picture they shared."
"Takes around ~2hrs to fill a 7L capacity, that too wasting in excess of 40L of water. My previous cheaper RO was better than this, including the resultant TDS rating. Very disappointed with this purchase.Update: Pureit sent technicians 2 times over.1. Fixed rate of water generation issue, but caused more water leakage and non-stop outflow even when power was switched off.2. Fixed excess outflow by part replacement, leakage had stopped initially, but has resumed once again."
Tank capacity and test of water is super . Must buy it
Tank is small relatively.  Otherwise would have rated five.
Tap arrived broken
Tap got broke within 6 months and they are not replacing the tap. We have been following up with them for last 7 days. It is not usable and they are not providing new tap. Is the expectation is to buy a new one within 6 months? It’s still under warranty and they are not even ready for replacement!
"Tap is broken after using it for 4days, return placed but yet no response from 2days"
Tap is missing. Amazon has sent the used and damaged item. Trying to return it since past a week..it's not allowing...
Tap water tase and filter water tase are same
Taste is absolutely fine. At this price it gives a good quality of purified water
Taste is like bisleri 👏
Taste is nice but takes longer to fill up the tank.
Taste is not good beat option is kent.
Taste of the water is good. It takes almost 40 minutes to get a full tank.
Taste of water and purity is very good.Value of Money product.Taste of water and Purity is very good.over all good
Taste of water as same as without filtration..I think I made a mistake by buying this water purifier..Not Recommended..
Taste of water changed completely post installing this purifierEntire service from delivery to installation was super fast and easy
"Taste of water is actually good, working good nice product"
Taste of water is so sweet and product is working very smooth also it's installation is very simple and best . Very nice product kinsco
Taste of water is sweet
Taste of Water is very good and Overall Performance is awesome
"Taste, quality is best, but service man fitting charge high"
"Tds Adjuster in not working properly. Tds not set as per standard. Fluctuations happening every time.I am advising to inbuilt TDS adjuster of best quality in this type of RO and provide cover with product.Rest are OK,"
"Tds adjuster is very bad, company has provided only close tap unable to adjust the tds in water, should give the adjuster like kent, kindly see this, t socket Nd the fitting is very cheap quality company should give that good quality. And one thing more there is not any off on switch in the machine. It noise too much when in function"
TDS and other things not checked but water taste is good.
TDS control option is very effective.
"TDS increases every day more than 250  as the TDS must be below 150. I purchased this device on September 2023, after that it's been he'll that I have given 5 times complaint regarding TDS high and we all got sore throat and health issues regarding high TDS and waste service and customer support. Never recommended at all, ban V guard purifier and save your health."
TDS is 83 after 3 month of installation.customer care not responding.worst product with worst service.pls don't buy.
"TDS is automatic and cannot be set, I request to all customers, do not buy it and request Amazon either to provide return option or remove such products, it's just waste of money. Only attractive look can't make any product good, if quality of work is not Good. I am very very unsatisfied, it's useless for me and non-returnable. 👎👎🙁🙁"
TDS is very low
TDS level is 146 after the process. Hence I'm not using it now and I don't know what to do?
"TDS level is below 10, working very well and silent operation. It fills 15 litre within 30 mins."
TDS Level of water is still around 300 and tastes very bad.
"TDS test result came up pretty good post installation. For me it was 71 when the installation executive tested it using his digital TDS meter.The device looks quite good & smart, minimalistically black with the LED white light ring  on the front, But it's also quite big and bulky in size.. so you would know the 9 stage filtration is not a myth in this :-)"
TDS was kept low as expected and I like that maintenance plan which is free for 30 months.
"TDS went from 130 to 60 ppm in Shimla,HP.I am satisfied with the installation,taste and quality of the water.Tap is a little flimsy."
Team was good and instilling also good so for no issue further if I have any issue company providing warrenty so livoure is good for home
Technical is very frndly and good behaviour with ample knowledge…
Technician akhil was good work .
"Technician arrived after 48 hours. Satisfactory setup. We went ahead with 4 years additional warranty with the technician, for Rs. 17,000 additional. So total 5 years under warrantly. All filters and electrical parts covered till 2029."
Technician confirmed product is not compatible
Technician has done professional job clean and smooth installation and equipment is working fine thanks
Technician has not done adjustment during installation for alkaline and minerals.  We observed as water was salty and bitter. Previously during my father's water purifier installation technician also did mistake. I think havells are not having qualified or experienced  installation technicians. After installation they must check everything but they are in hurry. Really disappointed by havells water purifier technicians.
Technician provide good service and his nature is polite
Technician was helpful in explaining the device operations and installed as expected
Technician was knowledgeable and friendly. I will surely recommend.
Technician was prompt and the work was very good . I am very much satisfied. Hope the team would help us for every service.
Technician was very polite and he has a very good knowledge about Water Purifier
"Technician was very polite, explained everything about the external filter as well. Good service."
"Technicians are not trained properly. While installing  it ,technician fixed RO filter just opposite way and TDS of filtered water was higher than inletwater. Inspire of repeated reminders, no response and support. No reputed company will  do so..."
Technicians gonna come for free service and repair the filter at the end of the warranty. They will charge 4000/ per year approx. I would suggest to buy some other filter other than livpure
"Technition is very good he came on time and install without any problem it was ease process, and shown demon of product, i am happy with the process."
Testing kiye bager ro bhej dete he or insulation ka 600 ₹ mangte he very bed quality product material is so cheap quality price jyada he quality ke samne please don’t buy
Thank for the product and service... budget friendly...I will surely recomend this to my relatives.................................Awesome.  Good.  NiceSupperSatisfied
Thank you Devaraj for the installation and explaining things clearly.
"Thank you for the amazing product , worth buying,even service is responsive ,hot water option is great at any time u need"
Thank you for the product. It's really worth. Installation also done very quickly. Response was very quick from your side. Technician also explained us everything. No extra charges taken.Thankyou
Thank you livpure aapka product 1000% acha hai but unke filter kit kaha milega

Thanks
Thanks for immediate installation help and explanation
Thanks for making product in reasonable rate
Thanks Mehraj for excellent service
Thanks to Havells for nice product
Thanks to v guard installation
"That is good product, and very good"
That is why Kent is bestIn every aspect it is the best
The 7 litre fits perfectly and doesn’t look bulky. Space saver. Everything is perfect with this except that we couldn’t control the TDS unlike some of the RO purifiers.
The adoptor was found working erratically..intermittent on and off indication of mains power despite being plugged in. There was no manual supplied gor guidance.  The Technician wanted a preesure control valve to be inserted between supply pipe and RO inlet owing to high pressureed water in the multistoreyed apartment . There is no guidance for this in the website or any manual(not provided). He wanted to charge 1600 INR for this.Most importantly as the RO was not working properly owing to defective adopter The technician did not measure/demonstrate the TDS. But surprisingly without my sharing the OTP the installation is being shown as installed satisfactorily.
The agent has completed the installation on time and it's perfectly done
The Amazon gave very fast delivery but aqugaurd service is very poor.No any proper communication for installation.The technician was so rude.Please do not purchase aqugaurd.Very disappointed.
"The AO Smith Z9 water purifier is highly regarded for its advanced purification technology, efficient performance, and sleek design. It utilizes a combination of sediment filter, pre-carbon filter, side stream RO membrane, and MIN-TECH (Mineralizer Technology) to provide clean and healthy drinking water. Users often praise its ability to remove various impurities, including heavy metals and harmful chemicals, while retaining essential minerals for better taste. Additionally, its digital display and alerts make maintenance easy. However, some users note that it might be relatively expensive compared to other options on the market. Overall, the AO Smith Z9 is a reliable choice for households looking for high-quality water purification."
"The app of urban clap show you everything what you want , as M2 is Wi-Fi operated , like you can know what’s is TDS AND HOW MUCH LITRES WATER YOU ISED EVERYDAY, it’s revolution in WATER PURIFICATION"
"The Aqua Frisch water filter from Amazon offering excellent water taste, features a standard build quality. Despite this its overall performance and flavour enhancement make it a reliable choice."
The aqua guard servicing man took 10000 for servicing and annual mantainance. Even after six months not one service  done after repeated.phone calls.costmer care.
"The aqua libra purifier I recently purchased has exceeded my expectations. Its sleek design fits perfectly in my kitchen, and the installation was a breeze. The water quality has noticeably improved, tasting fresher and cleaner. I appreciate the multiple filtration stages, ensuring the removal of impurities and contaminants. Overall, it's a reliable and efficient water purification system that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality solution to clean drinking water."
The aquagaurd purifier ritz is far better than my expectations. The instillation guy came promptly and attached the machine without any hassle. The machine is very convenient to use and the water tastes delicious.
The best water purifier in the country with 10 stages of purification plus freedom from maintainence for 30 months.Will definately refer to my friends and colleagues in the city
The best.
The body is weak and it breaks in 2 years. All filters needs replacement frequently. Not value for money. I purchased aquaguard because of shoddy after purchase service who don't seem to be professional.
The build quality of product is good. Taste and purification of water is also good 😊
The company will advertise free service. But very year you would be required to she'll out 6500Rs for filters and membrane s. Plus after initial year some or the other electronic part will require replacement. In that price you will get new RO from brands like livpure.Also huge amount of water wastage
"The day I bought i had been harassed by this product, every month i have to write a complaint, technician comes and changes something"
"The delivery was quick, installation was done the very next day and the technician was knowledgeable and professional. Provided a good overview of the product and suggested how to maintain the product for longevity."
The design given to this product is not good. Water always spills while taking water from tap.Not good tap designNeed modification to tap. Else good so far.
The ease of this product is good
The executive Shahal gave very good service.  Recommending the product for everyone.
The filter is compact has led to show its full and also the water taste is good. Would recommend this product.
"The filter speed is impressive, No leakage, High quality performance, taste of water is so good, nice design and storage."
"The filter stopped working and I have been calling their customer care for more than 2 months and no one has come to repair the product. Every time I call the customer care, they say we have escalated and the service person will come as soon as possible, but it has been two months and my filter is lying useless in the house. When asked to share the service person assigned, they say they can’t. Please don’t buy products from there, it is better to rent a filter at least there is a service guarantee unlike in this case."
The filter works really good. The taste of water is great after filtering. The reason for 1 star rating is due to the high maintenance costs. The technicians Kent assigns for half yearly maintenance is a 3rd party company and they charge whatever they feel like. Every 6 months they will change the candels (not sure if it was necessary or not). The maintenance costs me around Rs 3000+. It is just been an year and I have spend more than half of the cost of original machine in maintenance only. This is totally not worth it.
The filters pipes are of cheap quality
The first time in the my house that product
The game starts once you buy the product. Post service doesn’t bother to call. You somehow connect after 30 mins of wait on a toll ( not free) number to rehear technician will be at your doorstep in next 2 hrs; if you have a lot of time in life to hear eureka Forbes title song- just go for it else learn from my mistake don’t go near eureka Forbes aqua guard products
"The HUL Pureit water purifier exceeded my expectations with its efficient filtration system, ensuring clean and safe drinking water. The installation process was smooth, with the technicians providing excellent service, making it a hassle-free experience. Highly recommend!"
"The input TDS is 677 where the output TDS is 105 which is good for drinking. While using a RO filter, TDS was only 18. So, it was a great improvement."
The inside is stainless steel and the water taste good.It is sturdy and the quality is  good. Indicators are simple and easy to understand.Design is simple yet elegant.
"The installation guy wanted to connect the machinedirectly to the kitchen faucet and  refused to connect it to an existing pre filter that removes dirt. I spoke with his supervisor Srideep das baraipur crc group leader (call recorded). Supervisor clearly said if pre filter is not removed he will not install the machine and company will not honour the waranty if it's not removed.After I offered to buy another Ironil (Rs. 2500) that the installer technician was upselling, he agreed to connect that to my existing pre filter.So now there is now my existing prefilter, a new ironil prefilter and then the Marvel NXT."
The installation has been done via experienced guy. It was easy and smooth process to operate on this device. Will recommend to family and friends.
The installation is fast and well explained each details and process about the productAbout Technician: Good technical knowledge.Good attitude
The installation process was swift. Yogesh came and installed the water purifier very easily. Good service by Pureit.
The installation service was prompt and excellent. Quality of the water purifier is great. In my view it is win win situation to get such a good water purifier at such a great price.
"The installation services very good and fast technician came and he was very polite the good service, happy with product"
"The installation team cancelled installation and I need to escalate couple of times with Amazon to sort out the issue. Finally I had to resort to return of item. It appears that the installation was deliberately delayed to surpass the time window for return. Now the product is installed and return cancelled.The following suggested1. Product and installation are accounted as two different order in Amazon. Vendor should not be allowed to cancel installation alone.2. Wherever vendor requests more time for installation, date for return also to be extended correspondingly.Opted for the product as I was using Kent Water Purifier for more than 8 years owing to quality and service support though bit costly. So far so good but for the above experience."
"The installation was done nicely and the water system is really good. Fills the tank in about 15 to 20 minutes. I can sense a considerable improvement in taste, the chlorine odour from the water is almost negligible now. However, the installation guy informed that if filters need replacement, it will completely stop working. The ESF filters and inside filters, all are proprietory of this company and 3rd party replacement will not work. Say about 4,000 yearly maintenance. This product is more of a subscription in this case. It is not a feature if it stops water until filters are replaced. Also the ESF was used and had cobwebs around it, thus removed 2 stars."
The installation was done nicely.
The installation was good. The installation person is also good. Just now the item is installed. So far good.
The installation was great from Pureit. It was fast and prompt. The person gave us all the instructions and explained everything in detail. Great service 👍
The installation was not done perfectly and there was leakage of water from closet the technicians need more training and they should need to work more seriously
The installation was quickService professional was also very good and polite
The installation was smooth and the service personnel was very cooperative and guided well. Mr. Nilesh Mistry was very helpful…
The Installation was swift and performed at ease by nagaraju c g)lsp sree v n enterprises). He was very polite to begin with and was very helpful to resolve the issues as well.
"The installment was hastle free, came the next day itself after I called them the previous night, and product itself is really good for this price range."
The installtion was done  by agent Shuvankar. It was done very carefully and with all proper explation of instructions. We are very satisfied with the service.
"The item was delivered on next day only, fabulous responce/ work from AMAZON team. But very sadly I would say that pathetic response/ support from HAVELLS. I was told that installation will be undertaken within 48 hours on product delivery. However, despite calling them thousand times, no-one was attending the calls. The installment was undertaken after I told them to return the item.HAVELLS need to work a lot on it's Product Services."
"The item was ordered for our home at Dhakuria and since we are not staying in Kolkata.After opening the packing after reaching Kolkata today, it is observed that the top part (where water has to be poured for filtration) is broken. As sucj this cannot be used.Though the replacement window us closed, it is requested to either replace the item or at least provide a replacement of the top tank."
The Kent people never came for the installation. Terrible responsiveness
The Kent water filter is very good and it has all features that I required.
The Kent Water Purifier is a poor quality.. Don't buy🙏🙏🙏🙏
The Kinsco water purifier is a reliable water purifier that combines multiple purification technologies to ensure the highest quality of drinking water.
The machine was assembled and fixed in place and the pre filter attached but since the engineer did not have a suitable adaptor between the water source (house water supply) and the inlet to the machine the installation could not be completed.
"The machine was delivered in good condition, and installation was done quickly and demo was easy to understand."
"The maintenance of Kent is Very high , you need to spend 6500 every year to change the filters and the AMC cost is around 8k which covers one time change of filtersWorst experience with kent,  beware of purchasing Kent"
"The Marvel RO UV MTDS alkaline water purifier has a really good build quality, and does the purification really well making water taste better. The installation service experience was very seamless and the technician was extremely helpful"

Meanwhile I used to buy 3 big cans of water for cooking and drinking, this frustrated me a lot. Atlast, now I have bought this wonderful KINSCO WATER PURIFIER and enjoying my own house water.

Hi all.On top of +14199 rs I was charged 1300 for installation +399 onsite warranty. It's been 10 days since I started using this water and my health issues has become worse. I've been using bisleri cans (20l) thats worth 110 rs for 5y+ and i never had any health issue. The visiting technician showed me a tds of 59 after installation in his tds meter ( pre install 664, exhaust water tds post install 950) also the technician didn't have any ph strips to check. Mind you that's the selling point of this machine which claims to make the water alkaline. Using this water initially I didn't see it but i started getting pimples which I've never had, hot flashes, allergic rashes and hemorrhoids which has been persistent for over 10d now. Despite finishing one whole 60s pilex tablets within this week my symptoms are the same and it pains to sleep eat or sit. This brand and amazon has destroyed my quality of life. Euraka Forbes was a brand which I grew up with and that trust was spoiled by this one little expensive machine which is not even worth of 5000 rs.Brands such as euraka and amazon do not care wtr you live or die. Why do I say this? I called the customer care they literally told me the best they can do is replace and they can't take can action against the brand even if I have health issues because of this machine. And that replacement is validated only if there's physical issues with the machine!So amazon is aware that this machine  makes people sick and thats why they have in built policies which are detrimental to the buyers but beneficial and protective of investors like Eureka Forbes!Coming to the cost and worth. Machines out there worth 16k has smart app connectivity, inbuit tds meter, hot/ cold water dispenser, auto filter cleaning and monitoring, and water holding capacity way more than 6.5l. This kachada dabba has nothing but a foul black exterior with a filter adding poison to your water. Bangloreans deserve good water and atleast the state govt should take action such scamming moghuls.To add insult to the injury, Amazon app compares this with other worst machines in a bid to push customers to buy this. What do you call this ? You earn money not by stealing and definitely not by intimidation and coercion.How does it make sense to run business by killing people when they are the ones paying you!(Attached image: what the hell is this? Which company spends this much to built least ergonomic design to dispense and waste water in the process? )"

I am writing this  review after a month of using this purifier, the service provided by the company is very quick and good they used to suggest a best ratio eaither NF 20, 40 or 60 if we made a wrong selection. I picked 40 but after installation based on TDS technicision suggested 60 then company replaced with 60 filter without any charge. Thanks!"

I received this product one day after placing the order. The kent service guy came and installed it. After an hour, water started leaking. I called the installation guy and he sent an engineer. The engineer checked it and told me that the product is faulty and it needs replacement or return.I contacted amazon for replacement or refund. They accepted the request. But, nobody came to pick the product. I complained to customer care and they told me that they will investigate it in four days and update me about it. 4 days have passed and they have no idea about it.Now they have closed the return window. I contacted them today and I talked to customer care agent and he said he will transfer me to the concerned team. I am on hold for last 20 mins. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.ऑर्डर देने के एक दिन बाद मुझे यह उत्पाद प्राप्त हुआ। केंट सर्विस वाले ने आकर इसे स्थापित किया। एक घंटे बाद पानी रिसने लगा। मैंने इंस्टालेशन वाले को बुलाया और उसने एक इंजीनियर को भेजा। इंजीनियर ने इसकी जाँच की और मुझे बताया कि उत्पाद दोषपूर्ण है और इसे बदलने या वापस करने की आवश्यकता है।मैंने रिप्लेसमेंट या रिफंड के लिए अमेज़न से संपर्क किया। उन्होंने अनुरोध स्वीकार कर लिया. लेकिन, कोई सामान लेने नहीं आया। मैंने ग्राहक सेवा से शिकायत की और उन्होंने मुझसे कहा कि वे चार दिनों में इसकी जांच करेंगे और मुझे इसके बारे में अपडेट करेंगे। 4 दिन बीत गए और उन्हें इस बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं है.अब उन्होंने रिटर्न विंडो बंद कर दी है. मैंने आज उनसे संपर्क किया और मैंने ग्राहक सेवा एजेंट से बात की और उन्होंने कहा कि वह मुझे संबंधित टीम में स्थानांतरित कर देंगे। मैं पिछले 20 मिनट से रुका हुआ हूं। इस उत्पाद को न खरीदें."

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Aqua Libera Water Purifier, and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. From its sleek design to its efficient purification process, this device exceeded my expectations in every way."

I would recommend that do not buy this water purifier which is manufactured by Havells, this RO installed by the technician on 7th of February 2024 and after that I had lodged four complaints against the leakage issue which is not fixed by their technician. Either their technician is not much trained or something else. I am really fed up with this. I strongly recommend that do not buy this product."

Initially they asked me to give good reviews. But after 6 months I faced many issues on this purifier. Changed filters every 4 months once. Now water taste is very poor. Not changes in input and output.They told one year warranty but every visit need to pay 350rs. Very worst product it will work only 6 months.Guys please don't buy and don't waste you money. Other good brands cost is little high but service and quality is high.Not satisfied..."

Its been hardly 3 months from when i purchased this product and SF started blinking red initally pureit said it will glow red and SF required to be changed after consumtion of 5000 ltr of water but then they changed to 3000 ltr even though in 3 months 3000 ltrs of water cannot be consumed by 2 people. I ordered in Jan faced issue in March , got the SF cleaned then again faced iasue in June and paid 4500 to get the SF changed now in December again they are asking to get it chaned by paying same amout.  Its so costly machone and if we are paying in every 3-6 months for maintainence then its better to biy a cheap machine. Nor expected such low quality product from pureit. Not recommended at all."

Okay, first of all let me say that it's a good water purifier.But some of it's flaws are simply too much.1. The one that I've shared in the video. The digital buttons just start behaviour weird all of a sudden without even touching them. Although, it gets fixed once you restart the machine, which in my case is easy as there is a switch for the power outlet, but that's not the whole point. It's a bug, and I've called technician he's said there's nothing he can do.2. Another disadvantage is that it requires power for dispensing water which is already filtered and stored in it's tank. Gravity can do that. Yet, if there is a powercut, you can't get even the already filtered water .3. The auto cleaning technology seems to have increased the water wastage. I already hate the fact that ROs by principal waste water. This one seems to waste it even more, or maybe so do I feel, as I don't have any reference point. Currently I am using 20L containers to store discarded water and reuse it for washing and cleaning purposes and it discards water in 2:1 - 2.5:1 ratio. So for every 1 litre it discards 2-2.5 L water. That's just too much wastage and most of the people just let it flow down the kitchen sink which is just so sad and pathetic.4. It may be the technicians fault but somehow even after repeated requests and two times visits by the technician, he wasn't able to increase the TDS level of water from 65 ppm to around 105-100 ppm. Any good doctor will tell you that drinking water with too low ppm is not good. They say they have a mineral adding mechanism, but then how come the TDS continues to be so low. It's all very suspicious.Anyways, overall the digital buttons are a nuisance and right now they way they abruptly malfunction, they are seemingly becoming more than just nuisance. You can't operate them with wet hands, or they start acting up. They have too active sensors, so sometimes you try to touch a button and another becomes active just coz your hand moved over it. So silly.Too much technology is dangerous it seems. They ruined a basic functionality by trying to make it classy. Now it isn't even working properly."

Please don’t go for the product. This is not worth it. Need to service every 3 month.And the sales guy will say carbon filter and sediment filter is destroyed, we need to change and they will charge 1100 extra. After 6 months they will say we need to change RO Membrane and we need to pay extra 2700.Worst service by Kent.My machine is just 1.6 years old. It has drawn more than 8k in this duration.Please dont go for kent."

Product stopped working just after 97 or 98 days. Since then this waste is waiting to complete one year such that the warranty comes active. They are charging around 3500 if get it repaired without warranty. New product goes to be waste exactly after completing 3 months warranty period.

The top lid is not air-tight and lets in dust and fruit flies into the filtered water storage area. The overall fit and finish is below average for the asking price.

Using this water purifier from more than 1 month now. Packaging and Installation is good. This purifier can be placed on tabletop or can be wall mounted. Design is good. You can see the water level in storage tank with your eyes that is a really plus point. I have purchased a UV + UF model. Water purification is good and fast. It takes only around approx. 12 mins to fill the full 7-liter water storage tank. Filtration automatically stops once tank is full. It comes with 2 free services for next 1 year. Initially you will feel that water taste different but after some days it will feel ok to taste. You can open top lid of this purifier and can easily clean the tank by yourself. This is a huge plus point. If you want to buy a very good water purifier with trusted brand, then please buy this."

"The order came very handy. The installation person came the next day of delivery and did all the necessary testing including checking TDS of water and pressure of water. He fitted the purifier and showed extensive demo. He also provided the contact for servicing if there is a need.The filter also seems very useful, compact and elegant. Worth the price."
The outcome TDS WAS 300
"The output water is totally good,"
The overall product is good and water tastes also sweet but starting days taste looks like some metallic taste after some days it going normall
The Person had good knowledge and shared the same with us.
"The person was very knowledgeable,checked the tds both before and after, water pressure and advised on best practices"
The pH level maintain the good taste of water and the exterior body is just fabulous.
The plastic storage tank was the main issue. If it would have been a steel storage it would have been the best. Very dissatisfied
The pre filter is not available.
The product checks all the boxes regarding everything that is expected from a RO purifier. Additionaly this product not only has the looks but also major features which make it a great product.
The product had everything in it. No need to buy extra accessories for installation. Tank capacity is also good.
"The product installation team is not professional. They improperly connected the reject water pipeline to the sink where we wash the plates, resulting in a visibly unsatisfactory installation. Despite showing them the electrical connection, the technician claimed it wasn't within their responsibility, stating we needed to call an external electrician for assistance. As a result, only half of the installation has been completed."
The product installation was done on time.  The installation guy was really kind and did it within an hour . Overall good experience from vguard and amazon.
The product is a value for money as the quantity of the product is good as per the price
The product is amazing
"The product is average, but the technicians are unskilled. They do not know to install this RO. 1st After installation one of Poles fell of the RO. The pole lids were tighten too hard so the pole threads were damaged. 2nd the water output was too slow, it took 2 hrs to fill one 20 ltr can. 3rd Leakage started in one of the poles. 4th again leakage from another pole. Totally fed up of the poor service & bad technicians."
"The product is average. Installation was done by company for which I paid him money. There was a noise in machine which the technician said would go in a week. Even after 15 days the noise continued so I gave him a call. Again he visited almost 5-6 hours after given slot I again paid him. Noise reduced a bit , but pre filter and tap started dripping and till date I am just taking a follow up but there is no technician ever came nor anything happened. Worst service and product quality."
The product is defective and Amazon has not entertained my return request. I called many times but no SMS for return process has not been received.Its I will go Consumer forum.
The product is designed such a way that on one year to have to the kit replaces which cost INR 5k. So spending 21K on product and then 5k yearly on kit is not a good idea.. better look for other products
"The product is easy to install. The technician professionally installed the product.Till day 5, the purifier is working smoothly.The quality of water has improved.Recommended."
The product is easy to use and gives both hot and cold water on demand. Power savings and water dispensing quality is better than others. Very satisfied with the taste of water and operation of the product.
"The product is easy to use, and setup was simple."
The product is excellent and appearance is very appealing.
The product is full of fibre plastic. Water taste was good aftr intalation n after 2 days water taste was bit change. Havels service is so worst they guy who came for installation he was roughly handling the product. He just wanted him alone he might b trying steal something. Overall I didn't like the product n havels service
The product is functioning as advertised. Saif from Faber installed the product and was very helpful to get this installed on a holiday and then assisted with a faulty part as well. Great support from Saif.Would have hoped for better quality control from the brand. Will update the review once usage is regular.
The product is good
The product is good .
The product is good .Storage capacity is enough
The product is good also I like the design.
"The product is good and appealing. It's only 2 months since it's installed. So far,no issues."
The product is good and quality of product and service is good.
"The product is good and reliable, also very good service"
The product is good and the after sales service is excellant.The very same day of product delivery the support team called up for installation and next day the R.O. was installed. Later we found few leakages and the support team rectified the same the very next day on my complain at free of cost.Five star for after sales service
The product is good and the service provided is also good. Akhil help us to install the product and demonstrated the working of the product.
The product is good and the services given by the company are very good once you raise the request you get a reply o time.
The product is good and working properly
The product is good but it says 12 lits when we fill butIt stores only 10 lits
The product is good but lot of water gets wasted.. You fill 1 glass water 1 glass of impure water is wasted. which is ideally not right.
"The product is good but the service is even better. The technician came at the promised time, was very professional. I would recommend the brand to my friends and family."
The product is good I have been using it for 1months and i would highly recommend it.
The product is good justify its pricing.
The product is good so farBut need to see after few months
The Product is good the only thing I found missing is some led indicator whether it's on or not.
"The product is good, the only problem is at the time of installation this required pressure equalizer which is not a standard accessory and we need to pay extra for it."
"The product is good. But unable to register the product on pureit website as it says ""your device is not found""."
The product is good. Compact in size. Installation was also done properly. If you are staying in a society they would ask you buy a device to control the water speed which would cost around Rs. 750. Apart from that all is good. You may go ahead and purchase it.
The product is good. Only thing to improve the storage capacity. Purification is very good. It is really a good product.
"The product is great, but it doesn't come with a booster pump inside. If your tap water has low pressure, you'll need to purchase a booster pump, which typically costs around 2800 rupees, plus an additional 300 rupees for fitting and installation. Without a booster pump, it might take 5 to 6 hours to fill 7 liter storage, depending on your water speed. Make sure you have high pressure water supply before you buy."
"The Product is honest and optimum. It need not rely on cosmetic beauty. it is giving me satisfactory, stable and consistent service. It has been working predictably since for last one year. I am Happy...."
The product is nice value for money the TECHNITION is responded in QUQLY thank you Amazon
The product is not at all worthit. In span of 1 and half year it has completely stopped working and the team visiting for service claima that repairing will cost Rs 5500 which is equal to the half price of the the filter and equals to the price of some newly launched water filter.I would say big no to such products and nor would suggest any1 else to go for this product instead buy the newly launched brands which I m already using at my flat and is functioning well.
The product is of good quality but the service was really amazing and timely..i appreciate mr Antony(the service person) for his patience and attention to my queries and requirements regarding tds and taste of the water
The product is overall good but the installation was very late
The product is priced just. Service for 30 months creates a lot of comfort. Installation was quick and perfect.
"The product is quite good in terms of filtration, taste, time taken to refill and looks. However, there is a small yet irritable design flaw. The tap of the RO splashes water no matter how you close it. The tap could have been designed in a better way. Though, one get used to it after some time, still it is very irritating to close the tap everytime."
"The product is really cost effective, being students living together, this product has been of good use."
The product is really good at this price and the support team also listen to all your queries.
"The product is really nice, the function are very user friendly and worth buying it... One bad experience we had was the service personal who came to fit it very unprofessional at his work request to add feed backs and reviews even before opening the product. Kept the product on the kitchen slab connected the product and told us to do a number of things to get done and then him back to connect it back. While all the water line was ready to connect next to the sink said it wasn't possible and connected it to the washing machine water line and left... Unfortunately my plumber id a better job than him for sure.... Again love the product but stupid service personal just wanted extra payment to be made for every move he made.."
"The product is really nice, with a good price. The person who came to our house was very kind and gave a proper demo. Most importantly, he installed the purifier on time. Thanks for the good service."
The product is really nice.
The product is so good and easy to fill the water into the filter. Purification also happening very smoothly.
The product is so good and excellent so far. I had already used rented version of this item for over a year and now that I bought a new one which is excellent.
"The product is so good in this price range. It's been a week of usage and I am loving it. The installation service was hassle-free and good too. Thank you, team."
The product is stylish and has good features. The installation was also very good.
The product is unhygenic the cover is designed very bad which allows to enter insects /cockroaches in water tank very easily. i have lost the valueable money.  kindly change /replace the water filter with good covered purifier which will be good and hygenic for our family health
The product is unhygenic the cover is designed very bad which allows to enter insects /cockroaches in water tank very easily. i have lost the valueable money. kindly change /replace the water filter with good covered purifier which will be good and hygenic for our family health
The product is value for money and the service is good.
The product is very compatible and fits perfectly under the sink. The pro of having a UTS purifier is that it doesn’t take any space in the kitchen walls like normal purifiers which looks very bad.Ao smith is the right product to go for. Highly recommended!!
The product is very good
The product is very good and it is easy installation.
The product is very good and its working completely well.The purity of the water is good and water tastes good
The product is very good. The installation service was also very nicely done by Mr. Pawan and in timely manner. Very satisfied. Thank you Amazon and Faber.
The product is very good.taste of water is good.
"The product is very handy, easy to use quality wise better than kent, hot water 💧 is perfect!!! Overall best water purifier....a 5* product"
The product is very nice and affordable
The product is very sleek and purifies the water through different stages making it safer to drink.It has Great Value for  Money. Strongly reccomendable
"The product itself is all things good.It looks nice. It works well. The water tastes good.The service personnel were efficient, polite and did their job well.But there was a small hitch about the manual dispenser. Apparently this tap has to be paid for separately but that wasn't mentioned anywhere to the best of my belief. Moreover the technician wasn't carrying it when he came for the installation and I had to arrange for another visit and this second visit was chargeable.So I ended up paying 1300 bucks (950 for the tap and 350 for the visit) for a tap which I thought was included in the first place."
The product light consumption is very less compare to my previous and it’s easy to use too..
"The product looks attractive and is economical,works well"
"The product looks classy, it’s budget friendly and no need for servicing for 2 years!! The overall experience has been great starting from getting the RO delivered to making sure it’s working properly. I am a very happy customer ♥️"
The product looks good and finishing is eligenent the taste of the water is good. Totally recommend this product.
The product looks very nice and elegant.feature wise also its very easy and user friendly
The product Nature water purifier is very nice and good quality. Company service also very good.
The product of aqua purifier is just an amazing product which we have seen in Amazon app the best quality of water purifier thanks for supplying us .
"The product PureIt advanced pro system working perfectly, technician arrived on time and fixed efficiently. Thanks for the support!"
The product quality is great. Delivery was quick and installation was seamless. Good quality water.
"The product reached well on time, Good packing.... but even after 1 month the company failed to install the water Purifier and expressed inability to install it. Paid Rs 1300 from own pocket to get it installed after company advised me to get it done by third party. Looks like I will have no service when required."
The product s excellent and working condition is good
"The product seemed great, look-wise, price-wise, feature-wise and even the post sales service offers were great, so purchased this RO, Received 1 day delivery, technician arrived promptly after 2 days for installation.  All seemed good till then.  The technician kept on insisting on purchasing AMC for the 2nd year, told him we have 1 year comprehensive warranty for the first year, so we will think about it.  As soon as the technician left, noted that there  was water leaking profusely from under the machine, called the technician immediately, who said he will come the next day as he has other scheduled visits.  The next day, technician arrived, when asked about the leakage said, he said he seemed to have not tightened some part, and this will be resolved.  Noted there was still leakage after his service, he explained it is just the remaining water, will stop soon, which seemed a weird answer.  Again he kept on insisting for the purchase of 2nd year AMC, at this point I was a little sceptical about the whole purchase.The leakage persisted, though not as severe, but was quite evident, on calling the technician said he will visit the next day, but never showed up.  The next day, did not pick the phone.  If this is the case in a new machine and the service, wondering about the issues later on.  Finally decided on returning the machine."
The product seems amazing.
The product seems to be good and the installation done by Mr Satyam was excellent !
The product seems to be of good quality and sturdy build. The installation service was excellent. All the queries were attended. The service partner also explained why the machine requires less maintenance. It  has a backwash system for longevity.
The product service is very poor and not even responding correctly and moreover the worst consumer care not even have solving capabilityMake sure buy another product which has good service dont eve choose Eureka Forbes
The product was damage with in 2 months the membrane was bending and water leaks from it and it directly go in to drinking water so the water TDS change to 380 so I don't recommend this product to any one
The product was delivered and the technician for installation came the next day. It was a very smooth and professional process.
The product was delivered on time and also installation was done very promptly.
The product was delivered on time and then installation process was smooth. Working fine till date. Value for money. The look is also good.
The product was delivered on time. Support was nice. Installation on time
"The product was good only for few months ,no costumer service provided even after multiple complaints, even after changing the filter it is not working well .Called several times to the customer service they are saying to pay extra 5000 for the exchange of filter.Very disappointing .Worst consumer service .One star for the initial one month functioning without problem."
The product was installed in our office.  Does not take too much of space and can be mounted on a wall. The product  is working as expected till date.
The product was not working. They did not come or Service contact Number was not available. So i used local service personnel to repair the newly bought machine. pathetic peoduct. Dont buy from this seller.
The product was very good 👍👍
The product which was delivered is very perfectly fine and good but the service is not good as we called the customer 3-4 times but they were saying it will take time
The products is very good and having led indicators which shows purification tank full and power looks nice. Service of kinsco is also good
The products performance is up to the expectations.The water taste is good and looks good tooThanks faber and amazon
The products works good for past 10 months.Simple and value for money. only once replaced ro membrane about a month ago.
The prooduct is very good i am fully satisfied with the product.
The purchase & delivery was a smooth experience but the 3rd party service provider who came to install didn't install the sediment filter as it was ordered via Amazon along with RO. He charged additionally to plug the sediment filter & said this is a usual practice. I had to incur an additional cost for it & was unpleasant experience.
"The purchase, exchange, installation all went with no issues. The purifier is working as expected. Satisfied with the entire experience."
"The Pureit Installation is done by Mr.Yogesh , I love the way he handles the product and the process of the installation, i would like to give 5/5 rating for installation."
"The purifier from Havels is very fantastic, cost effective, good looking, easy installation and the quality of the purified water is very good."
The purifier is not working properly due to to some loose contact issue. I called the technician 3 times.The technician said before using you tight the connection. How can we do the same everytime before use.Iam not satisfied with the product.Now I can't return the same as the return time has been expired.
The purifier is too good. The taste of water is quite good.
The purifier is working as expected  and taste of the Easter is also good as expected till date. Installation was smooth.
The purifier is working well.
"The Purifier makes lot of sound and vibration.I have escalated to the customer care number will see want will be the result.I usually prefer make and made In India products, if this is the product I have to think about?"
The quality and service is very good
The quality is top notch no doubt.Eat to fit and assemble.100% satisfied
The quality is very good. I have little suggestion; if possible please simplify the arrangement of that rubber cap for dispensing tap.
The quality of product is very good. Over all in this price it is very nice. Thanks Amazon for delivery the product on time.
The quality of RO System is quite good. The best part is their customer support service. Well organised team who are prompt is responding to queries and reasonably fixing the issues.
The quality of the product is good. The installation service was also quick. Overall family is happy with the service and the product.
"The quality of the product is very poor, the tap stopped working after 2 months with regular use. Raised a complaint with UC but no resolution yet though it is under warranty. Better to buy water purifiers from other well known brands."
"The required water pipes was not delivered. And delivery person does not let us to open the packet also, technician checked it and we found that pipes are missing"
"The RO Aquaguard Marvel NXT was delivered successfully on time. However, the RO has still not been installed because the engineer who called me said that they have run out of pre-filters. This was not expected from a brand like Aquaguard.Please buy at your own risk."
"The RO Filter is very nice,the water is clear and good to drink and the company could fix alkaline filter too for better sales"
The RO filter is working fine. Installation was provided by the company and they were on time and totally hassle free. Technician was on time and did the installation perfectly.
The RO is good and installation was a breeze. working perfectly for last 3 months
The RO is not as effective and does only minimal cleaning of the water.I had to buy another RO as the window of return was very small.
"The RO is really good. It’s stylish too . Installation was provided by the company and they were on time and totally hassle free , happy with my purchase."
The RO is workin very fine
The RO is working good.taste of water is enhanced after purification.during installation I don't find any hole for power chord.hope that it will be addressed in future
"The RO is working well as expected, even though the installation is free of cost, the associate might suggest some additional fiiting equipment (extra charges) which you may or may not get installed.For me he suggested the dust filter to be installed (the extra filter that you usually see installed outside/beside the RO unit).I dont have any problem with paying for it, its just that for other RO companies, the dust filter is a part of the installation process and you dont need to pay anything extra, but Aqua guard doesn't include it in your normal purchase. One request to the team, to please mention the extra equipments in the description of the product as well so the customers can have an idea of any additional costs."
"The RO system is really worth for the money paid, parts are made up of quality material. Only the draw back is they charge a fee of Rs.500/- for installation, the unit is given with a pre-filter and the package contains all the accessories. The output RO water quality is amazing, it tastes almost like Bisleri mineral water. The after sales service is commendable, they attend immediately and rectify the problem and also replace the faulty accessories that falls under warranty. I strongly recommend that this product is a worthy product compared any branded RO system."
The service and product is good
"The service centre from Kolkata are pure thief ,I have 2 machines at present.In one machine the problem came they took 1000 rs without any invoice and bill ,the machine stopped working next day .when we called they told to give more 2500/- this is pure thug system.how can someone charge 3500/-without any invoice and bill of 4000/- machine.They dont provide any invoice also.Dont think of getting service ; use it like use and throw machine."
"The service is very good, the installation man came after one day that delivered😃"
"The service of this company is very bad.  When I called for service, they fitted the filter upside down and went away before guaranteeing that it would be fixed."
The service was excellent and water taste is adjusted as required
The servicing of Kent ro is worst. Everytime you call them for servicing they will tell you your filters are not working properly and we need to change them. Changing them cost around 4700. They only have 3 months of warranty and after every 4-5 months they will ask you to change them. It's soo costly to maintain kentro i would not recommend this to anyone.
The SMPS of the filter has been found faulty.
The speed of the purification process and water taste is also good.Over all good product..We can recommend others.....
THE STORAGE CAPACITY IS LESS AND THE CARBON FILTER AS WELL AS THE MESH PROVIDED HAS TO BE CLEANED REGULARLY OTHERWISE THE FLOW OF WATER IS VERY VERY LITTLE.
The taste is not good at all. No taste change
The taste of water is like draining waste water and the product is cheap please replace or stop making these kind of products
The taste of water is very good. But the filter starts leaking from the box in 6 months. This happened to us twice. Not sure if we go for a repurchase again.
The taste of water is very good. Product quality is upto the mark....All in one water purifier from Pureit
The taste quality is good but the water flow is quite slow .
"The TDS level in water in our apartment is quite high. Based on other reviews we went in for AO Smith Z9 model.  This product is amazing, user friendly and the taste of water is very good.  The hot water function is also very good.  Overall this produce is really great.. Go for it."
The TDS level of the filter is quite higher than the normal level. Your technician is also unable to rectify it and asking us to get in touch with you for exchange as it is under warranty
The technician came and installed the filter next the itself after the delivery. The technician is also very good.It is worth buying in this price range.Overall good product.
The technician is very bad.  I had a problem with Aquaguard and they did not even come to fix it and did not even answer calls and I faced a lot of problems related to it. Please change technician
The technician Mr. Ravi came at the committed time and installed the system and checked the same thoroughly.
"The Technician was in a hurry and did not wait until the first stage of purification but was in a hurry to leave. Without the User Manual I cannot operate the Aquaguard. Also, he did not have a clamp to fix the white and blue hoses to the wall and left them loose"
"The technician who came, Tarun Saravanan was very well trained and did a good job … Happy with the overall experience 😊"
The technician who installed my machine was very efficient and very well behaved. He gave me proper demo of the machine and went an extra bit to help me out. Very happy with his service. Would like to give him 10 on 10 for his service and behaviour.
The technician who was assigned was really helpful and was very patient.
The test of water is really good
The under the counter installation makes the kitchen slab neat and cleanEase of use.
The vguard installation process is very slow...The technical team is very lethargic and is not coming to install the purifier kit
"The warranty is limited period, it could be better like for three year. Within a year and half the filter in fact all of them has to be changed. It will cost almost 30% of purchase. Also resale value is very low. Mistake by technician are not covered like breaking screw placement glass. Overall this headweight for maintenance."
The water color changed after boiling
The water flow does not stop automatically. Continuous flow.
The water heating capability is very good
The water is of good quality and I like the product.
The water purifier is cost effective. Delivery and installation service were good. I have been using it for about a month. No complaints yet.
The water purifier is good but it’s knob is a bit problematic. The edges are sharp. If not handled carefully then might cut the finger. The model is sleek and good looking and does the purifying efficiently.
"The Water Purifier is working properly though I had an initial problem but Technician rectified it and it is back to normal. Writing the review after 2 months , Purifier is good for daily usage plus strong built."
The water purifier looks good and it's water filter process looks reliable and smooth. The product installation process is completed in a proper manner by Mithilesh Mishra is a very professional way and he also explyme about the product usage  donand donts.
The water quality is so good i purchased it 7 months ago and there has been no issue till date.The installation team was quick too.Overall a good product at the price you’re getting
The water quality is to be enhaced
The water quality was perfect
The water taste was good and worth to buy
"The water tastes good, the filter refills quickly. The installation was done promptly within a day.Only problem we face is the water level is not clearly visible"
The water tastes so good to drink a lot. It's adequate capacity for the family of 4 persons
The water was delivered on time and installation happened in a same day which was unexpected. I’m happy with the product so far.
"The way product is designed , it is prone to defects. The product I received stopped working after 5 days of installation, and since then we need to contact customer care every 4-5 days as problem keeps on recurring. The technicians company sends don't have proper knowledge and training, they just call someone else, send pictures, and then whatever they are informed , they just do temporary solution. Moreover they are not replacing the product as we brought it online, they simply say if we had bought it from offline store, they would help properly. It's just so tedious to register complaint again and again, call customer care and deal with different technicians each time."
"The worst functioning product,  worst experience from the installation team."
The worst purchase ever made. I ordered this product and they took 1 week to arrange an installation personnel. Within a week it stopped working they didnt provide service we had to call local person to get it serviced. I had to pay for the charges even though it is in return window they said they will refund the charges but they havent. The purifier again stopped working and I am totally helpless. I will file a consumer complaint on this product. This is really a worst product please dont buy.
Their service is very bad. I received the product 9 days before. The product was defective but has not yet been replaced.
"There are three cons with this product when comparing to other products with same price in the market.Cons1. Capacity is very low. When in need to fill bigger container, you have to wait.2. Tank invisible and so we can't know , level of water within tank.3. Tap is given on the top of the machine and so kids cannot draw water. When you keep the container under the Machine, water spills out.."
"There is 0 service from UC, they say parts are not available, what is the use of 2 year warranty? Do not fall into this trap."
there is no option to increase the tds in this product. Disappointed
There is nothing to dislike in this . This is use for drinking water for home use
There is nothing to dislike..it's a good product..very good for personal health care things it's an amazing product.. must buy
There is only 3 filter in this and It does not contain MTDS. Company does not respond and there return policy is very bad. Do not buy this if you want to save your money.Just go with other brands
"There is small ball valve (like inlet valve) in the filtering section and it was in close/off mode by default, even though it is in off, the purifier works. What is the use of this valve there?Should it be in open position or close position?What will happen if i open this valve?And how can I adjust the tds level?"
"There is water leaking from the cylinder that’s adjacent to the purifier, all the time."
There was a part broken inside the filter . But luckily we got fixed . So next time please check 1000 times and then send to the customers. It's not free that we are taking we are paying for it. Please😠
"There was a sensor issue, after the right technician reached and fixed it, it is working fine now."
"There was leak from machine from day one, also the person who came to instal, was in hurry  as if he has no time & busy. In general.disapplinted when i compare it with KENT. i have had 3 KENT, no issue."
There's a leakage in the water filter
"They are selling at very very high price.  Products looks its not worth that price.  Don't get foolish by seeing its pictures.. Also, there is water leakage when bottom tank got filled. Top filter continuesly filtering the water even after bottom portion get full. So that water getting leakage.  Don't buy"
"They have installed a chip so its mandatory to buy AMC from them every year as no outside technician can repair the purifier. To top this the purifier stops working automatically every 4 months or so. I have paid AMC of 3k every year. The worst happened when I tried to book service as the purifier stopped, no technician has come by for the past 3 days. I have been drinking bottled water. I have been buying aqua-guards as far as i can remember but Eureka Forbes have really failed here and their customer care no, no one answers. So everywhere you are dealing with automated messages. Horrible!!!!"
They mentioned 15 Liters on the Websites but the Product tank is only of 8 Liters.I have measured the full water by measuring cylinder. It having Only 8 liters of Capacity.
They will not perform the free service as they promised and whenever we create service request no response simply voice message will say service ticket opened no one will contact later.
Thia product ia very good to work. Thank u for Amazon.Product colour and every parts are care fully packing is perfectly nice. I really like and happy to received thia product..
Third class product & service
"This  was initially purifying water within maximum 20 minutes to the full 8 ltr capacity, for first 3 months. Now it's taking much longer time almost 1 hour. Few days back I did services from Kent, but it was disastrous. It was good, but i received a non-working UV filter but service person exchanged at no cost."
"This aqua guard has basic features and easy use technology. It looks good and decent in appearance. The water quality also looks fine and using past 7 months. The only thing is that you have to fall back for installation service as from Amazon delivery did not get any service for installation but after getting product, I happen to call customer service for booking the installation service. This is how a little thing happened. But over all product is working fine for now"
This Aquaguard purifier is very good and the taste of water is excellent
This Black coloured water purifier is very sleek in design and has efficient workingOur guests also appreciated it's looks.
This device has great performance and water test was nice . Installation team call me with in 24 hrs and install the device properly. Technician is the best.
This Faber product has troubled write from its installation. Poor service coupled with intention to extract money in one way or the other is the highlight
This filter works really well. The water tastes nice and I really liked the design as well. Will recommend 👍
This hul brand service center very very bad....Customer care too much liar...
This is a 3rd machine i have purchased from Livpure.i am happy with livepure since customer service good
This is a beautiful and extremely useful product. Like its look and the taste of water. The technician who came to install was very cordial and informative.
"This is a fabulous one time wonder RO. While the RO is amazing the after sales service is too pathetic. The warranty is useless as no one attends. In the 11th month I thought to get it serviced, the person came and changed some electric component saying it will help.after that my RO is dead. It has been 15 days now and I have written, spoken to , tweeted, emailed to everyone including grievance officer and  the chairman pratik.pota. seriously never seen such a company which malfunction its own product and not attend or give responses. This is because they are waiting for warranty period to elapse so that they can charge under the garb of amc etc. I saw these kind of reviews earlier while purchasing but still went ahead because of Eureka Forbes name but it's a sham business where only customers suffer"
This is a good product with genuine price and features ratio. Also the support team is quite good and had the smooth installation done.
This is a great product on great budget. The water filter filters 900 tds water to 97 to 104 tds range really loved it
"This is a new brand, but the purifier is definitely good. Water taste is also good. Maintenance and everything regarding the filter can be seen in the app. But the only problem is the purifier turns on every time you take even a glass of water."
"This is a perfect water purifier which can suit common man and its value for money, it filters water with less wastage. It’s an go-to product"
This is a very nice product delivered by Amazon.
This is a worst product. It's always get air even though there is continuous supply of water. It's chalk always gets fail. Situation is like that we always have to register complain with the Kent each month . On each visit of technician we have to pay approximately Rs1500/- to 2000/- .Please avoid to purchase this product. Not Recommended to purchase. Headache product.
"This is an amazing product , with good capacity and quality."
"This is an awesome product at very fair price and service of installation incl after sale service also good.....keep it up Team.....Purifier water , healthy life , better and bright future of India."
This is easy to install and service was very quick. Water tasted good. I paid 1000 rs extra during installation for water purification.
"This is easy to use, good service."
"This is handful, easy to handle, good and quality performanes"
This is in-line and good for moderate requirement (city municipal water supply)
"This is my 3rd product. In my all 3 house we are using this product. Style is so good, No motor sound & compact."
"This is my first purchase of Kinsco water purifier. So far so good. The product quality looks good, and it is working well after installation. The cost of installation is a bit steep and it would be interesting to see the product and service quality in a years time."
This is my first water purifier other then Kent. Really nice move by this company. It's given many features at this small price and also 2 years maintenance tension free. Water taste is also great and technician is also co-operative and installed at time. 5 in 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"This is my Genuine review, The product received on 15th March, installation is not done till todayvery irresponsible technician & teamDon't buy this producti will write review again once installation done"
"This is my review after an year of using AO Smith, I have almost repaired it around 6 times already in last 1 year ,and 3 times changed the adaptor.i would not suggest this purifier personally,I think we have many other better brands that doesn't give much of a problems as such.."
"This is my second installation.What I love most about this filter is how easy it is to install and maintain.With just a few simple steps, we had it up and running in no time, and the low maintenance requirement.Also, the installation was on time and the installation guy was very friendly and knowledgeable."
This is my second purchase. This time I purchased for my parents very nice.
This is not zero water wastage it wastes lot of water. TDS of drinking water provided by purifier water is 86. I think water filter has become a business. Annual maintenance is 5400 Rs. Please be very wise when it comes to water filter.
"This is really the best product in this low price, worth the money"
This is the best thing you can filter the water
This is the best water filter at affordable price. Their service is also nice and on time
"This is the first product I purchased from Eureka Forbes and this would be the last product I'm going to purchase considering their pathetic service. Even after a week product got delivered, no one from the company bothered even to call and confirm the appointment for installation. I had to call their customer care everyday (waiting avg of 15Mins) to connect with a representative to hear the same assurance of assigning an installation personal by end of the day! At last after a week I received the call from installation technician giving rubbish reasons to avoid coming for the installation. Out of frustration when I wanted to return the product, Amazon stated that I should talk to brand directly. And when I talked to Eureka Forbes regarding return they stated to contact Amazon! I felt like foot ball being kicked from one goal to another. After 15 days of all these non sense, I decided to install it by myself watching YouTube tutorials. Never ever going to believe in this brand in future."
This is the third product which is not working properly even then it is from a reputed manufacturer like AOsmith. The product stopped working for the second time in first months itself. And this is in continuation of my other purchases like a Samsung LED TV I did from Amazon.So one thing I could figure out that Amazon has resorted on onboarding bogus sellers who sell B- grade quality at a little lower price and customer gets allured.Here onwards I am going to purchase all my high value items from tradition brick n mortar stores like good old days.Only buy such items from Amazon when you can live with a second grade quality
This is the worst product. No one is ready to listen even after many complaints. I bought this product for Rs. 19000. But it didn't work even for 19 days. I complained but no response from the customer service. Now the warantee is finished. I have discarded the product and purchasing the RO water from supplier.
"This is the worst water purifier. Their service is pathetic. Even after buying AMC, they don't come for periodic service. Never ever buy their product"
This is the wrost product. Full wastage of money. No service provided by company.
"This is third class product and pls don’t buy this,  within 2 months filters and motor failed tried calling call centre and their is no proper response."
This is very good and useful product and companyservices is so fast response for any Query for product no.1 product in this segmentThanks 🙏
"This is very good product in all aspectsDesign, water quality and everything"
This is way better than the other available purifiers in this range.
This is worst product ever. My RO stopped working after 1 month and when I reached customer care they said they will not provide the service for the product purchased on Amazon .
"This Kent supreme was initially purifying water within maximum 20 minutes to the full 8 ltr capacity, for first 3 months. Now it's taking much longer time almost 1 hour. Few days back I did services from Kent, but it was disastrous."
"This machine doesn't work even 3 months. I had to replace membranes 2 times in 4 months. Bad product, bad customer service and overall not worthy to buy. Stay away."
"This machines is absolutely useless. TDS comes around 600 , the quality of machine is absolutely poor . The service even under warranty is chargeable and the customer support is absolutely.I will advice against ever trusting this company . It's a scam ."
"This Model comes with smaller size RO Membrane ,Which is not available with service centre.Wonder why company sells a product for which it doesn't supply basic spare part.Feel like completely cheated"
This model is very good and This product is very good usage of our family.
This model of purifier is very cost effective better than other products in market which is costly and gives same functionality. I recommend this product.
This model reduces the output water TDS to 5 which is highly unsafe for human consumption when input TDS is 350 . The product specifications does not mention that we need to buy TDS controller in addition . This model is total waste of money .
This product design good and fill the tank quickly and less wastege of water.(20% to 30%max)
This product gets faulty often. I have tried every method to repair but it doesn’t help. I would recommend local purifiers or subscription based purifier if you’re planning to get a water purifier for home.
"This product I purchased after reading several reviews, I really liked it quality. Installation was prompt.Cons:Warranty doesn't cover filter.Rest everything is working good.I'll update my comment after 2 months of use"
This product is awesome very nice must buy n customer service is also very good but dilvery service is very poor
This product is come with electronic chip  by which purifier automatically tell us for change cartridge amount of which is around 3000 to 4000 Rs .Which is very high maintenance cost .Machine cost to me is 5600 after discount and technician tell me maintenance cost is around 3000 yearly which is unjustified and very high.
"This product is delivered in December_Also it is not working properly, have been requesting to vendor many time since 29 feb but not responding yet _"
This product is good ..
This product is good and budget friendly service also is there
"This product is good for municipality water in Kolkata municipal  water TDS is 218 so no problem 2use this purifier but for the first two round of full tank filling water taste will be different then 4rm 3rd round taste will be ok as original. My installation from Kent authorised service also done at next day with no extra cost. If u like AMC for 12 month u can book from direct Kent authorised service it will cost u Rs.2500 including full service with filter change, UV lamp & SMPS only plastic body not included in the  service. If required outside sediment filter will cost u extra."
This product is good quality. Using since obe month and such issue is observed. Model is good look.
This product is good. Installation was quick and smooth.
This product is incompatible for municipality water. Please don’t buy it if u want to install for municipality water
This product is installed by Sourav Sahir on 31 Mar 24 and he is very polite man and told me everything about uses and product specifications.
This product is not good.interior filter is not working properly.so I return this Havells water purifier.
"This product is not worth even 100/-  ..The item has nothing with copper as claimed.  They have NO installation service,they will put you on 3rd party.Finally Amazon will flatly refuse to take back the product claiming its their dumb policy not to return products your are not happy with  ."
"This product is pathetic. Since installation, we can see oil particles in the water. I have raised the complaint with Kent 6 times but haven’t received any resolution. Had to return this eventually.Very very awful experience with Kent."
This product is very bed and and seller denied not selling for this product
This product is very expensive
This product is very good and their services are excellent
This product is very good to use .. I m so happy to purchase it
This Product is Very Nice
This product is very nice and we all shall have it  is also of low price
This Product looks promising and gave good filtration compared other brands which are much costlier that this one.Water tastes good as of now and no issues.
this product made by good quality and looking very good design .
This product Malfunctioned within 3 months and started to give unpurified wanted which resulted in all my family members falling ill. Do not go for the product if you care for your family.
this product quality is really really good & looking is awesome this product is such nice RO 👍🏻👍🏻
"This product seems to be good enough, even it's pretty much slim and light weight. I must recommend for its purchase.Well Done - PURE IT."
This Product will be non functional within few months and you will not get any support.
This product working only warranty period then after not works please don't waste of money
This product works on electric or non electric kindly reply further tap connection is required or not what type it works
"This purifier doesn’t maintain steady TDS. It is over purifying the water. Sometimes TDS is touching as low as 20 which very unsafe to drink. Service is not good, they take 4-5days on average to attend ( It may differ from region to region). I’m planning to dump it and move to another product."
This purifier is good but the thing is uh will have to face many issues it will stop working continuously nd it’s filter will stop working after 6 mnth nd if uh have the warranty still uh will be chrged for it so be careful choose something else
This Purifier looks great after installation. 30 months free service should prevent me from all the post-purchase hassles. Let's see how it goes.
This purifier was good in all the aspects and went with a smooth installation.
This Purifier worked around 5/6 months without any issue...! Later for 1.5 year I kept around 6k for repairs and now i'm getting 502 TDS...!! Please don't go for this option.
This Purifieris properly placed below the dink unit and it doesn't occupy a lot of space. Been using it for last 2 months. Water quality is good. It has a relatively smaller water capacity in storage but it gets refilled soon.
"This review is only for the installation service. Will update the review with product details after using it for a while.I ordered the purifier on Sunday, it arrived on Monday, and the installation was done on Tuesday (location: Bangalore)The technician arrived in the morning (Madhan). Installation was done very professionally and in the location I requested. He showed how to use it, the problem indicators and the TDS levels before (164) and after (98) purification.He also inquired whether I want to install external sediment purifier to which I said yes. It's easier to clean the sediment purifier than it is to clean the main unit, so I opted for it.It's not part of the unit and is charged extra. All good so far"
"This RO water just swift my previous RO water flavor, can't believe. Let's see how many times it will work.My opinion storage capacity as per your family no's otherwise need to 2 times fill the storage"
This time disappointment from A.O smith..Not working even on giving power supply.. installation technician said adapter is not working.A new machine sent has such a problem ….very disappointing..😔😔
"This water purifier doesn't work properly, it doesn't filter properly. Water test funny. Sometimes sands came out with filtered water."
This water purifier has value for money because it has providing a 5 different kind of filters in a single machine. In under 10 k
This water purifier is definitely value for money. Copper and technology is it's attraction and longevity is assured. The water quality from this purifier is awesome. Not much of water getting wasted in the purification process unlike other water filters.
This water purifier is excellent.
This water purifier is ideal for every home. It has all the features required as per order. Works nicely and gives clear water.
This water purifier worth for this rate...
Thnq eureka for wonderful product and awsm assisstance
Though it's too early to give feedback I can say only for now the installation was done perfectly. Aquaguard is well-known for 2/3 decades.. Hope it works perfectly.
Till now experience is very Good
Till now it is working good. It's cost is much lesser than other water purifier compa
"Timely  delivered ,installed by technician on time."
Timely delivery and quick installation
"Timely installation & follow up from the team, delivery was perfect, the product is working excellent, we are using for resort purpose"
Timely installed. Hassle-free experience. Well explained.
To filter and purify water
To much sound of the motor... the time when tap water gets refilling inside purifying system.
Today installation is done. Good part is this installation team continue chasing me sir once Product received will do installation .And today Faber team visited and get the installation done. Team are very helpfull. Thanks. Deatil review will share after using atleast a month.
Today my native M1 got installed and the service engineer has done a great job! 100% recommended
Today Purifier installation completed it is under monitoring now I will share product review based on performance
"Today the purifier machine's wall hanging hook got broken and the machine fell down from the wall with full 9 litters of water, luckily no one was there.It's a clear manufacturing defect since the hook isn't capable of holds the weight of 9 litter water and the same leads to doubt the safety of the machine which hangs on the wall.When I raise this concern, company executive responded and admitted that after the warranty period even the hook can broke they can't take the responsibility. This proves KENT is no more safe.I can pay the service cost but the company should admit hook can broke after warranty period and you are not responsible for any serious injury happened."
Tomuch noise in working
Too bad product after 2month i placed 4time complaint but problem not resolved machine is runnig all the time 24/7
Too bad serviceAfter installation product was not working properly
Too costly
"Too expensive parts ,doesnt last more than 1 year. I brought ladt year for 18k, withon 12 months i its imgibing alaram to replace all 5 filters that cost 7k .We are only members in family so usage is vrty less."
"Too much expensive,yearle maintaince charge around 7000.00, with free service, you have to change all filters once a year costing 5000.00, if you install extra iron remover, it will be changed every 3rd month,costing 500 X 4 = 2000.00, total  7000.00 per year, not recomended at all for midle class family."
Too pricy. Same product is available in local market at cheaper Price
Totally unsatisfied.No one calling for installationDon’t go with kinscoAfter sells not getting serviceDon’t buyNot recommended
"Totally waste of money,  product do not pure the water."
Touch panel is good and the water quality is good
Touch screen at defaultReported uc they bought new one for replacement but tried installing new one screen also not working
Tried booking service but they have so pathetic response that they done care to reply ..and push you buy their AMC...bought hardly 2 months back and started issue with the product
Tried the water purifier with lots of thinking but it works nice. Good product for the compititive price.
Truly satisfied with the product.
"Trusted tha brand and purchased 2 Water filters and ""PROVEN"" has kept it's assurance in water taste and quality."
Trustworthy
"UC does not have enough ground staff for RO service though they are a market leader in their own segment. I guess they tried a copybook strategy of business school learning to convert a crisis into an opportunity and brought a product that does not require any service for two years. With some hype, paid promotion, brand familiarity and innovation (recurrent cost on RO AMC is huge, so it must have provided a right disruption point in the market for a new entrant), they have become a best seller. But I regretted buying this product when in spite of multiple calls to their customer care the installation did not take place. It was delivered by Amazon on a Saturday and my woes began after that. There was no automatic installation initiative, and I had to request for installation manually. In spite of talking to UC customer care and sending emails and trying to schedule installation on their app, no installation was done on Sunday. I was given a slot on Monday, but then as I was hoping for the installation they suddenly changed the installation to Thursday! On top of that, I started getting messages from their customer care addressing me as Piyush! I am a registered customer of UC, have been using their app for home cleaning for years and I came to this conclusion that the sudden leap in business has resulted in their systemic malfunction.So on Monday when they suddenly changed my installation schedule without even consulting me and deferred it to Thursday, I had a word with UC customer care to complain but the executive told me to try to reschedule again by using their app, which was another red signal. I could see that it will result in a consistent headache as their systems are simply not capable, and while entering RO market they are trying to chew more than they can bite. They don’t have ground staff, they are selling the units with a promise of no service required, but it seems there is in effect a “no installation possible because we don’t have any RO teams yet” message written between the lines.Discussed with my wife, and eventually raised a request to return the item as UC seemed to be apathetic to my plight and it was already more than 4 days since delivery.But Amazon has been very diligent. Not only they arranged the return and refund, they also raised the issue with UC, and UC executive called to apologise, saying that they are giving me 500 credits to my UC account as a compensation. Amazon rocks.I shall still continue to use UC for the purposes I have been using it for long. But RO, I shall go with time tested companies. By the way, I have got same day installation from another reputed RO company after this disaster from UCYes, other companies won’t promise you a two year period of no service required. Their AMC is costly (after discounts I’m getting 8k for two years) but then the first year free service is covered in warranty so you only come under AMC after the first year. Here in UC you still buy AMC, but after two years. And honestly, what happens when you require service during these two years, will they be prompt to send a technician? No prizes for guessing.Thanks Amazon. And no thanks UC."
Under sink purifier is one of its kind and I am really with the overall service... excellent product...
Under the counter water filter very few options available in marketThus is among the top
Upper container lid was small compared to caontainar size its not fitting properly at all .This is very bad experience about this brand and product.Don't buy this product at all.I was unable to exchange because I sent that product to my Village.
Use this for last one month and I am absolutely satisfied with this water purifier.I suggest please purchase it without hesitation. The quality is good very budget friendly works great and very tasteful and clean water.
Used aqua libra old models also. Service and product quality getting better with time. Just go fir it blindly. No reason to look for any other highly priced water purifiers.
"used filter Membrane ,getting TDS 105ppm above, RO should be below 25ppm"
Used for 2 months as of now its a good product and good service
Used product sent... Complete accessories too missing...Visible marks on body where someone has already installed it before ..with screw marks on backside and body also had scratches ...
Used pureit in the past… it is similar… just make sure to clean the inlet components at regular intervals of time… you should fine
"Used this RO, it purifies well and worth for a price"
Useful
Useful good quality 👍
Useful product. Easy to handle.
"Useless product, no company responsibility, customer care washing up hands you have to pay for service n parts within warranty when it's not working since beginning"

Using it from past fewmonths good product.TDS level brought down from 650 to 50.using additional pre filter as well both are excallent.worth money. water wastage is also less.where ever rental option is not available its a good purchase option. Little delay in service except it all good.

Using the product for almost 3months now and I am very satisfied with it. Do not have to boil the water anymore
"Using this product of 2 months. Having a good experience with the Under the Sink AO smith water purifier, it saves the space as well and water quality is up to mark. Worth to buy."

I have bought Faber water purifier in April 2023, in 4 months I have to replace UV membrane. After 01 month of replacement, leakage of water started.I reached Faber service from September, till today I approached almost every month. 02 times service executive turned up and said he will raise ticket for wiring/PCB replacement as it is in Warranty.But after that there is no call or message. I tried to reach again but there is no response from executives. There are no lights displayed and water is leaking ."

For the 1st month worked flawlessly, then started the nonsense, in the past 10days I have booked 3 service complaints as the purifier fails to fill water. I have an external pre filter installed too so there is no way any solid impurities can hamper the functional capabilities of the filter. The water purifier shows blue light as in filling stage but absolutely no water not a drop fills in the storage tank. Technician says Air Lock hua Hai.  This is absolutely un acceptable every day am I supposed to call a guy to open the purifier to release this so called air lock. I had another brand purifier earlier which was an RO based one and that worked flawlessly for 6yrs since we get very good municipal corporation water supply now and there was no reason for a RO based purifier, i put my money on this Faber product thinking it would be a good product, now thoroughly regretting my decision........ STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT"

Don't buy"
Waist product continuous repair and service not available on time
Wall Mounting Broken and Ro hanging please replace it
Want to change the product it's not working water not purified.
Want to keep it short n to the point- Overall good product in a decent price
Warranty active
Warranty is useless as you need to pay for filter uv uf etc if stops working within 1 years
"Warranty of no use  bought on Nov 19th 2023 stopped working on December 24th 2023, do not waste you hard earned on something like this 🙏"
Warrenty card is not given with the product.please give me warrenty card. Delivery box was open at the time of delevery.
Wastage of water.Wastage of money.Not providing outside filter.Outside filter is advised later at extra cost.Would like to burn it in front of havells showroom.
Waste of money time and efforts you put in installing this. Once you order then starts your task of reaching customer support tirelessley for arranging paid technician to install it. There after youll see machine stops working with annoying reasons of different reasons within week days.Finally go better renowed company ones though costlier which lasts long and serves your purpose.
"Waste of money, better to buy offline and other brandI m reviewing after one year, need repair and service every 1-2 monthsTill now I have repaired two three spair parts."
"Waste of money, poor quality, motor is not working after one day of installation"
Waste of water too more....  I was choose worng product ..
Waste product no service at all two times I ordered no installation service came
Waster of money. Water tastes the same after filtration.
Water after purification is good and tds level is adjusted as per my request
Water drips in very slowly
Water feels very light now. It's taste is also good. Technical team visited to explain the features of product. Thanks a tonn
Water filling passes through the carbon filter which is slow. S o it takes a while to fill the water. Carbon particles occasionally come out and block the final filter candle's input.
"Water filter is not working well, The bottom tank is overflowing There is no overflow protection. Unhappy with this product"
"Water filter speed is just like a drop a second ,have to spend 2 to 3 hours just to fill 2 to 4 litres of filtered water from it.Don't buy the product it's just a waste of time and money."
Water filter. Good quality.
"water Flavor is ok .But it is very noisy at this price .It only filters water with electricity, so No electricity No waterAnd please check the product dimension before buying because of its design/shape in my case it doest fit in my modular kitchen RO window get"
"Water gets dispensed randomly on its own without anyone touching it. And user input is not honoured properly, If you press one option, some other option gets selected randomly.  No testing seems to have happened before releasing."
Water gets purified quickly and has 7 stages of purification
Water is good in taste after filtration .
"Water is good,modal is good, good purifier"
Water is pure & tasty .. also satisfied with the technician & service after sales ...
Water is very good... Tq for kinsco

Water licks from the tap from the first day. Uv lamp blinks some times and produce a sound when start

"Water outlet piping cannot be done, the whole product is useless as it can't provide pipe to water pot."
Water purification is good and residual water is also very less
"Water purification is very good, but blue colour indicator is not working, and tds adjuster is not there, and UV light not givened separately like (zinc+Cooper +UV) one cotrige"
Water purification process is fast and taste good. ..overall it's good !!;
Water purification quality is very good....Tap quality is not good... its very difficult to operate with wett hands... Tap is broken in only two months of use...
"Water purification, it is working well and water quality is good."

Water purifier storage is not 7 Lt  pl confirm if capacity
Water purifier was re-installed by Shahal from V-Guard. Technician was punctual and knowledgeable. Impressed by the care taken by Shahal and he made sure all are working perfect before leaving. Great to see a company that not only sells a quality product but also backs it up with excellent service!

Water Quality and Taste will be excellent...
Water quality GoodPurifier design was good
"Water quality is considerably better than my previous water filter. Must buy for people with a limited budget. One thing to note is when the time comes to replacing the filters, it will cost the same amount to purchase all the filters but I suppose expensive filters will have the same situation too, so that should not be a concern. A good purchase under 5k."
Water quality is EXCLEENT when compared with KENT RO.

Water spills over due to bad tap design
Water tank broken down 2 times in 1 year very bad product very bad after sale service do not buy.

Water tap slowly. For a one glass full taking  more time. Tap water Switch poor quality. First 1 lit water out fastly but after very slowly.
water taste and flavour is worst . from the beginning we are suffering with this problem.

Water taste post purification is very good
Water taste was good worth for money easily recomended
Water tastes good
"Water tastes good, its alkaline and beneficial as well.installation was done on same day. automatic cut off is available once tank filled the full level.UV and copper, alkaline cartridge doing the job well. Greatly reduced TDS leves. Looks good too. Happy with the purchase."
Water tastes good. No issues with working and functions.
Water tastes really good. The design is very sleek and fits in very easily below kitchen sink. Tap is also sturdy enough. Doesn’t make any sound while water filtration. Overall i am really happy with the purchase.
"Water tastes very bad and unable to use it. I brought this product and am very very disappointed. Am noticing this week from the day 1 after buying this water purifier. Also, i could not able to return it since it passed the due date for return. I dont know what i need to do with purifier now."
"Water TDS is dropping to 20 every month and I need to call the service guy to fix it. As a new product, I expect there should not be any issue. Better to buy the water purifiers checking in a shop and buy there itself."
Water TDS not correct setting after two time setting by technician
Water test goods. Tds controller is automatic. Ph level is 9. It's a good product. Value for money.
Water testing promotes good health. This product is highly recommended for ensuring healthy water for everyone.
"Water us overflowing, inspired of repeated complaints, Noone turned up"
We are currently using this product for filtered drinking water.
We are happy with this product. Quality is good and they delivered the item on time. Look wise it is similar to display on Amazon.
"We are living in Village of Rajasthan where water is supplied by Govt. from Indira Gandhi Canal . Water is without florid and supplied for dinking purpose. We Filter it with Kent Gravity UF Membren system which provide us satisfaction for hygienic . Delivered safely by Amazon even in our village area , Thanks"
"We are processing your review. This might take several days, so we appreciate your patience. We will email you when this is complete. It stopped working.AMC is 7k per year."
We are satisfied with the product.
We are using this product and so far good
We are using this product since last one month & is working properly. Look-wise is also very attractive & with reasonable rate.Engineer came for Installation was very polite & explained product features.I will definately recommend this product.
We are v happy with AO Smith entire family members and very happy with AO Smith
"We bought it last week  and it's one the best in the market, totally worth it if you are looking for budget friendly this is best"
We bought it only last week. So far it’s is working good
We bought this one in DecemberNot yet completed6monthsIt stopped working 2nd time since last 10daysOnly 3 months it worked properlyWorst one..... poor service ...... money oriented
We face the issue of water leakage from the U tube pipe due to thread issue after the installation .Any new product having the warranty so plz look after this and reslove the issue.
"We got the bad experience in engineers,they did not respond,wrost in kent service centre.properly nor working my Kent water filter."
"We have been using Aquaguard for many years now. Recently, I moved to a new place and bought this water purifier.It cleans the drinking water perfectly without a doubt. It can hold 7 litres of water at a time, so it will be perfect for small families.The best part is that they send an associate to fit the purifier in your house after the delivery is made (this is done free of charge), so the entire headache is taken up by them.Just go for it."
"We have been using the Eureka Forbes Aquaguard since time immemorial but now this os our first venture into something new for water filtration and we are so glad. Also, the service of Eureka Forbes is phenomenally bad. They are slow, inconsistent and their filters are easily available in the market, we don't know whom to trust.AO smith people were smooth, prompt and customer centric services were there during installation. The whole experience was perfect.Post installation the machine is advanced enough to let us know when the filters are to be replaced with a light indicator and we can just raise a query for service on their app which is addressed within half a day or so.Superbly happy with the whole experience! Highly recommended!"
"We have earlier , some years back purchased RAMA Product. SS quality is very good. Hope same is maintained for present product."
"We have ordered the purifier for our cloud kitchen, overall it's a nice product with enough storage of 15 liters, Highly recommended at a reasonable price range"
We have received our order on Friday and it's Thuraday still the installation is not completed. We have been trying to reach out to the technician but he had cancelled the booking twice which is very dissapointing.Please do not order any water purifier from Amazon especially if Havells company.No point of receiving the order early as the water purifier is still not installed and such bad support service
We have received this product okay. After few days it started to give problem.They are not replacing the product and forced us to accept the faulty product by giving service. They service it and again problem. Who will pay once the warranty is over?
"We have recently purchased the AO Smith water under counter, 5 litres of drinkable storage capacity. Water tastes feels good, pure, machine no noise and installation was done on time. Overall liked the product. AMC charges feel more, company need to consider. In my case, we are purifying ground water and it's clean and pure, it tastes good."
We just installed today itself for review we néed to wait some what experience.
"We like this model of Aquaguard as it looks very sleek and provides very good drinking water from relatively good input water. As this is not RO, lot of water is saved and also, the touch control works very nicely. As there is no storage also, stale water is not used. Totally good value for money."
We liked the touch and hot water feature
"We made the mistake of purchasing this product, in spite of having no real track record of Service. The worst expectations were exceeded when for for days we tried to schedule the service to get it installed only to have- the customer service number of Livpure to be completely useless- to be put on hold for 15-20 minutes without any response- for the local service center assigned for the insulation to ignore or cut calls for five days- And finally have a service executive five days later to inquire about what kind of machine was purchasedIn case anybody thinks this is some small town. This is in Delhi.End to end one of the worst product experiences I’ve had in India. would not recommend to anyone."
We purchased  Livpure water filter 4 months back and it started overflowing after 15 days and till we registered 5 complaints for same but still problem persists.There service attend time is minimum 20 days sec very unprofessional services executives.
We received the equipment on time and the installation was done in the most professional way. This is working very well for now and saved me a lot of energy lifting heavy water tins all the way up!
We recently got this water purifier installed. It's amazing.  The quality of the product n service is really good. Go for it without a second thought Thank you KINSCO 😊
"We recently purchased the AO Smith under the counter RO, 2 months in and it’s been working really well. The taste of the water is much better than other ROs that I have used in the past. Great after sale service!"
We use only 8 days but after that not working and also customer care not responding
Well explained and smooth installation was done by technician
Well for money product
Well functioning.
Well service
"West product ,  worst response,  4years no warenty service"
What you expect from Ro u will definitely get  Worth for money
"When box was opened, the three pin plug was broken, anyhow, returning or exchanging is a long process"
"When filtering the water some soind is coming, installation person told that will reduce in 2-3 days but it has not reduced, otherwise product is good worth for money"
"When I inject under RO ,water is not coming from RO"
When I open the box the wire was damage and was not connected to the purifier.
"When I purchased this RO, the installation guy visited my home. He checked water TDS of my home tap water before even opening the box of this product. After checking he said your home water already has very low TDS and hence this RO won't be suitable for your home. He refused to fit the machine. Thanks to Amazon support, I could returned machine.  Buy this machine only if your water source is borewell with very High TDS>300. Machine doesn't have UV filter."
When open to clean after month noticed Screws provided got rusted and all rust deposited in water tank. Plastic also of not good quality.
"When water filter starts filtering, it produces lof of noise. Unnecessary beap sounds. It filter less than 50 TDS level which is not good for health"
"When we got this installed, the installation guy scammed us by mentioning that machine only works 85%, tds will not reduce. Also they fake signed the installation receipt and wrote the wrong details in it including wrong residential address. Now after 3 months the tds has increased very much as machine is not working properly, and the service guy says that this machine does not reduce tds and they will not service it as machine does not reduce tds. Pureit cheats its customers through scams like this. We are now again buying a different RO."
When you buy a high priced water purifier and you get a very bad installation and then you need to pay for the installation charges. Very bad build quality.
"While the warranty is 1 year on device. Magically the device fails after 18 months, and you pay extra 4000 rupees. Every 18 months."
Whoever is planning to buy any product from aquaguard make sure you know their definition of warranty. According to Aqua guard customer rep Ms Shreyasi the definition of warranty is servicing or cleaning of the product and not repair and replacement of defective parts. So under warranty if the machine develops any defect you have to pay for the parts as well. Also I got my stuff fixed or getting fixed only because I had bought a gold AMC worth 3.5 k. So if you're ok with their definition of warranty and product durability (not even 6 months) then please feel free to give them their hard earned money and request them to repair and replace ur product for certain exorbitant price after waiting 15 mins for the call center person to respond..Couldn't give them a zero star hence 1..
"With 2.5 years of extended service, Allura RO is a game changer in all ROs in the market. With RO UV Mineralizer taset is also good."
With goodtaste to sweet water that I see in it
With great hope bought  this vert expensive  item from Amazon...4days over no installation  support.  Finally did self installation..some output is coming. Just a suggestion..buying  and getting  installation  and service  support  from this  Amazon apporoved supplier according  to your convenience is bit tough  for a common man. Technisions  are fairly  busy..
With in 2 months they visited 5 times. Still have the issue. While filter water giving very noisy
"With that price rangeWith that brandNot satisfied.No taste enhancementNot removing the bleach, iron smellLeakage if you full it upYou will have a maintenance cost.In my experience with nearly 5000 price better go for RO wall mounted."
Within 10 days of purchase the purifier stopped working. Customer service promised a 24 hr resolution but it's been more than 3 days and no technician has visited. Called Customer care several times only to hear the same statement that they'll send the guy but no one arrived. Will update this review once it's fixedBad product and bad service
"Within 12 months of use the outlet water is coming with visible dark particles... All the filters are changed on time... When contacted, they say the bush needs to be changed... So, it will cost another 1800 rupees with additional 350 rupees as service charge... Every 1 or 2 years this bush needs to be changed it seems...Wont recommend anyone to buy"
Within 2 years I had to call service for 10 times. Product is completely damaged now and servicing company is asking 10k for repair which is actual cost
Within 3 months it's not working .not providing any service .no response at all.keep on complaining to customer care but no response from  service technicians.pls  don't buy this.  Will never buy any product from vguard .
Within 3 months motors gives more sound. I called to service they told motor not covered in warrenty. Really I felt bad with this product
Within 3 months the product uv lamp and buzzer got failed.After that service is also very poor it will take more than 1 months to fix the issue. very rude behavior from technician side as well.
"Within 6 months of usage, the wall mount broken. Placed a service request with kent, even after a month  they did not do field visit and closed the case without my concern[ the product is in warranty]. I regret to buy kent ro. Their service is very very poor and not acceptable. I urge customers not to buy as they could avoid this kind of negligence and irresponsible service behavior from kent."
"Within just 2 months of installation, it makes weird noises from inside and the sound starts getting louder with each passing day.The red light starts blinking continuously even when water sources is fully connected.Despite repeated complaint forwarding, no service technician came to visit my location, worst after sale service by V-Guard company."
Within one year three times sevices and finally stoped working and service agent told it will take 6000 to repair and cost of purifier is 8500. I am going to throw it out
"Within two months of installation, the UF filter has been faulty multiple times. And they are not replacing it, everytime they just beat the filter with the screw driver.Service booking is really easy, but service executive is very amateur and untrained.I had to log multiple complaints for Low water flow within a month of purchase. The same service executive came both times and he just banged the UF filter with his screw driver both times. He didn't replace the filter even second time. Now waiting for the same issue to happen 3rd time.The service agent was not trained to work on this model and I had to assist him to fit the filters back in the body. Water filtration rate is very slow, approximately 12 Litres per hour. (12 L/hr).I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Buy from other good brands and always purchase the purifier with high quality filters."

Worse product.
Worse product.... Does not fit properly.. Water Filter component does not fit tightely upon each other... Dust or other things enter inside top tank.
Worst
Worst after point of sales service from Eureka forbs. Would not recommend to buy Eureka Forbes product.. Pathetic experience so far
"Worst after sales service, water stops automotically after 6000 litres and they don't replace the filter on time ,don't buy this Product"
"Worst customer service from Eureka forbes, below personal experience:1. Installation took couple of weeks even daily follow up, executive was calling for giving feedback on amazon but was not able to support on quick installation.2. Two free services were promise with product purchase, no one visited my home even once in first year after purchase, called customer service appointment was scheduled but no one visited home, even on call mentioned i will be charged 530 rs even though its free service but didnt come.3. Time to change filter, looking at various ads to but genuine products to ourchase AMC, opted for gold AMC, filter not working since a weeks , done multiple follows on call center, twitter, grievance id but till now no once visited or given any details when my filter will start working again. Today (13.04.2024) filter is still not working and no one provided any info about timeline or what is the issue.So will strongly suggest to rethink before buying any aquaguard (eureka forbes) produscts. Worst after service by this big brand. Disappointed"
Worst experience pls don't buy display light sensor don't work properly After installing the purerifier to home and they don't give bottle in box service experience is worst  After 4days the service man came  Now the problem solved 👌🏼
Worst investment i had made because this filter is not working every after 1 month and the engineer who will come will change every part and at last when you fed up of this he will say ro is damage now
Worst product
"Worst product ,many problems . please don't buy."
Worst product and company .. how to install no body known verry bad
Worst product and service ever. I have spent so much on the service and planning to get rid of this purifier !!!!!
Worst product and worst customer service they are not able to identify the problem
Worst product ever please don’t buy
Worst product not even working all the parts which given was not working. Taking money from us and giving damaged product
"worst product, and worst customer support from Eureka forbes, I have paid Rs.3039 on March 2024 18th and  took Gold plan booked for a filter service after the warranty period, but till now it was not attended and my money was not refunded for the cancelled amount of Service amc Rs 699/-. Water flow is less and quality is not good"
Worst product. It leaks after 2 days of usage also there is huge maintenance cost in this machine unlikely other brands. I don't recommend it at all
Worst products and performance its 4500 garbage dont buy it product very cheap and cheating with customers hrmi no warranty
Worst productThink twice before putting your hard on money in Urban Company Water Filter.
"Worst Quality Product,filter water TANK got crack after 6 months, water is leaking"
Worst RO ever my honest 1 year experience is horrifying. I was using Aquaguard for the past 10 years also have an AO Smith RO.I DONT KNOW HWY I BOUGHT THIS.There are multiple issues with this product since purchase i have complained for this product almost every 2 months.
Worst RO ever purchased. They promise one year warranty that is  bull. Filter stops working in less than seven months. Pure it person comes and asks for  Rs 4000 for filter change.They are liars and cheats who would not disclose anything while buying the product and later on show their true colour when you are stuck with product.My advice is to go with other brands that is going to give you pure water for at least one year or else be ready to empty your pocket.
Worst service after installation..they don't respond ..never buy it
Worst service don't purchase Havells all products
"Worst service I ever experienced ,  customer care number also doesn't exists, service booked through the slot by installing app and no response yet. It's not been a year also but the purifier is not working."
"Worst service worst experience, in one year I spent 20 rousand rupees and still iam drinking amelled unpurified water, don't buy Eureka Forbes products"
Worst thing.Installation tea asking me to buy1500 rupees product which is not mentioned in product description
Worst worst product I have ever seen in all aspect. Do not buy or rent this product at any cost.
"Worst. Lot of water wastage. We need to service the pre filter for every 3 months , where urban company mentioned no need of service for 2 years. There is no service indicator."
Worth filter servicing for clean water by Faber .

Write now every thin is okay
Writing a review after 6 months of using I have been using Havells Ro since 2015 and previously I used Havells Max (rs 15000 approx) and now using this one Havells Fab and believe me both are doing the same great taste and great design so you don't need to spend 16000 or 18000 just purchase this one
"Writing a review after using for more that 10 days. Rama gravity water filter is very good for TDS upto 150. It provides very clean water, fast filtration and very easy to install and manage. Water storage is also decent for small family. If you have TDS more than 150 in your area, go for some UF+UV electric filter.The only problem with Rama filter is that it leaves some amount of water left unfiltered in the bottom area always i.e. lower side of candles. Rest of the water is filtered pretty fast and very good to consume. We always have to throw that unfiltered water, which is kind of some wastage. Other wise product is excellent and highly recommended."
"Writing after 6 month of use, not at all satisfied with the product.Earlier it take 15 days for servicing then Kent representative asked to install Iron guard that cost 1500 . I have install that still my problem not resolved .In every 30 days it need servicing. I am thinking once the warranty period over how i handle the maintenance cost."
"Writing the reviews after 4months of filter usage.Pros-Best Nano filter in the market till todayWater taste good as it filters the TDS level as per claim.Very good customer service, never experienced such service from other filter company till date.Constant follow up from customer care to ensure customer satisfaction for the service provided.Cons-Not found any till date."
Writing this review after 3 months of use. The product quality is fine. the indicators works fine to show full tank. Although my installation experience was not good as the installation guy charged extra which was returned after complain. Also the installation guy should have knowledge about the TDS.
"Writing this review after 5 days of installation. Product is working fine, but water refilling is slow compared to my old aqua guard purifier."
Writing this review after 6 months of purchase. The service is worst. The filter not working after 6 months and asking more than 7000 rupees for replace of filter just after 6 months.It's better to avoid KENT.
Writing this review after a month of usage . Its been a great buy Kinsco RO water purifier is best and water quality is better than pricier branded RO purifiers. Installation was prompt and installation guy came next day of purchase and completed installation without any extra charges apart from Rs.700 which standard cost . Since then using this and i am totally happy with this product will recommend to buy in this below 10K range .
"Writing this review after almost a year.. Wastes twice as much water as other RO filters that I have used.The worse part about but their post sale service costs of around 5K, very high for a device that cost me 7k to purchase. Go for brands like Aquaguard if you are looking for long term and third party service support. Will be getting rid of this in six months once I am done with the current filters."
"Writing this review after installing the product. There is nothing copper inside it’s all plastic painted with copper and the filer picture I have given is faulty, I had to buy new filter so that tds level can come to double digit and make water drinkable. Pls don’t waste money in this crap product and buy better brand."
"Writing this review after using this purifier for almost 10 months. It’s one of the worst purifier i have ever purchased. It broke down within 10 months, kent technician are not trained enough to fix under the sink purifier. It’s been more than 20 days since my purifier is not working and technician are still not able to fix it. Kent has the worst service and customer support. I do not recommend anyone to buy this purifier."
Wrost product don't buy
x
Yeah everything is good but technician work is not satisfied
Yes like this product
Yes. drinking...
You may face the issue of fungi inside the storage tank. Otherwise solved the purpose. Average product
you need to service 5 times a year this ro to work properly. first spend 20000 to buy ro then 20000 for service including spare parts. membranes which cost 3500 rupees need to replace 5 times in a year with moderately use(3 member family)
You will be ghosted by the installation agent.What is the use of buying a product that will sit in a corner for days without being installed for several days.Mind you - Self installation will void the warranty.
"You would regret buying eureka forbes aquaguard water purifier. You'll get frequent repairs and get no service. Their technicians would not attend your service request even for 10-15 days. And when they come, they will give you hard time to buy an AMC which has pathetic service. Don't buy eureka forbes products."
"Your installation guy Sonu is very prompt and polite ..He knows his job and was honest and quick ..He did not ask for any tip or.extra charges ..Very satisfied with the serviceAlso Important Before the product was delivered by Amazon He contacted me 1 hour before that if the product has reached to me, so he could come for the installation Job...Great Job..Thankyou"
Zero wastage water purifier but the pipe is suggested not be put back into our main water supply to avoid the RO filter from getting spoilt quickly
"Zinc, copper, tasty water all are perfect"
अच्छा लगा
"कंपनी की सर्विस बहुत ही खराब स्तर की हैं, मैंने 15 जनवरी 2024 को v guard का आरओ खरीदा था, आरओ में दिक्कत आने पर मैने 2 फरवरी को complaint की थी उसके बाद भी कई बार और कंप्लेंट कर चुका हु लेकिन v guard  ki तरफ से कोई भी एक्शन नहीं लिया गया।"
प्रोडक्ट खरीदते ही 20 दिन में खराब हो गया. 2 बार तकनीशियन को बुलाना पड़ा...20 दिन तक लगातार कस्टमर सपोर्ट और एरिया मैनेजर से फ़ॉलोअप करने के बाद भी तकनीशियन नहीं आया.. तो मैंने मशीन को गुस्से में तोड़ के फेक दिया... कभी ज़िन्दगी में livpure का कोई प्रोडक्ट नहीं ख़रीदे... बेचने के बाद कोई ध्यान नहीं देता
बहुत बेकर प्रोडक्ट  है कोई हेल्पलाइन  नंबर नही है ना हि कोई इनस्टॉल  करने आया
